# International Terminology of Acrobatic Gymnastics

In this glossary, which is an ongoing work in progress (you can contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/floshin/acrolib/edit/main/glossary.md)), you will find all kinds of acrobatic terms known from or associated with acrobatic gymnastics (short "acro") and acrobatics in general. 

Over time we will add terms of diverse languages, associate them with the related terms from other languages in order to reduce the current confusion when talking about elements with people from another country (or even just a different acrobatic school). On the basis on this research we may try to suggest a terminology, a common language, based on the most precise and most commonly used terms. 

We may later include a search function so that you can search for terms you heard of but don't know what they mean or to search for terms you already know in order to learn how they are called in other languages. In the meanwhile you can just use the default search function in your browser.

#### Handstands

* **Handstand**
* **Inversion**
* Category A: "Normal" Handstands
* Category B: Arch Handstands, ..., an Arch of more than X° is called a Deep Arch.
* Category C: Piked Handstands, also called L-Handstands, since the body forms an inverted L, in english most often called "Seven", since the body has the form of a "7". A variation of the Seven is the "4", which is like a seven, but with one leg bent, resulting in a shape remeniscient of the "4".
* Category D: Flags, ... A Flag with the legs oriented downwards in an angle of 30-45° is called a Deep Flag.
* Category D1: Gripped Flags
* Uncategorized Handstands:
  * **Visulka / Deep Pike / Icycle**
  * **Over-Figa**
* **Figa** is a One Arm Handstand from the category of piked handstands with a 45° rotation of the back with the legs held horizontally to the floor. A Figa where the back is twisted so much that the legs are not oriented sideways but behind the body we refer to as an Over-Figa. A Figa in which the legs are not held horizontally but pointing downwards as in a "Deep Pike" (Visulka or Icycle), we refer to as a "Deep Figa". Both Over-Figa and Deep-Figa are not yet categorized as unique handstands in the ToD. 


##### Supports

* **Supports** are categorized in the ToD among "miscellaneous elements". We are suggesting to describe them as supports and consider them as a subcategory of handstands, since they are also performed on hands and have been termed as Supports in artistic gymnastics. A support is thereby defined as a balance element that is held on hands, but in which the upper body is *not* in an inverted position, as in regular handstands, and not held above the shoulders.

* **Tuck-Support** is a balance element held on the hands with the body in a vertically tucked up position (not in a horizontally tucked up position, which would be a tuck planche). Less precisely it is described as a "Tuck Sit", which we prefer to name a similar position if actually seated on the floor.  
* **L-Support** is a balance element held on the hands with the body in an L-Shape, where the upper body is in a vertical position and the legs are held straight and at least horizontally to the floor. Commonly also called L-Sit, which we prefer to name the position in which one is actually sitting on the floor. Another name for this element is "Pike Lever", as the body is held in a piked position. We do not prefer this description, because the body can be held in a piked position in these three different ways; a V-Support would also be a piked lever, just as the Visulka as the other extreme. Therefore we would choose "Pike Levers" as a categorisation of different Support Holds in a piked position. There are two variations and progression forms of the L-Support which are both useful and important for higher level skills: 
   * L-Support with higher compression, where the legs are horizontally to the floor, but both the hips and legs are in more distance to the floor, e.g. at the elbow level. This progression develops the necessary compression strength for L-Press to Handstand on the floor.
   * L-Support with higher feet, where the legs are not held horizontally, and the hips are not raised significantly compared to a basic L-Support, but the feet are raised significantly higher, away from the floor in an upward angle. This progression leads towards the V-Support.  
* **V-Support**
* **Manna**, "Over-Support" or Russian Lever
* **Planche**, ..., A Planche with the hands being apart by at least three times the shoulder width is called a Wide Planche. A Planche where the Arms are completely in a horizontal line alongside the body is called a "Maltese" or "Deep Planche". 
* **One Arm Planche** is a planche on one arm. According to the ToD of the FIG a one arm planche is not possible and can therefore not be performed. One arm planches as performed in Calisthenics are not considered actual planches by gymnastic standards due to bent arms and many other technical shortcomings. The element is said to be impossible because it is assumed that it can either only be performed with a bent arm and/or with the body heavily twisted or not completely horizontal; in the past and for many years the only person known who came close to a clean one arm planche was a handbalancer called [Professor Paulinetti](), who performed it like this; as can be seen the arm is still very visibly bent. In recent years some handbalancers such as ??? and calisthenics athletes such as [Valentin Blanc]() have shown one arm planches with an almost straight arm, but a microbend remains. We think that in the future the possibility of one arm planches may have to be reconsidered, but the difficulty is so extreme that it is unlikely to be performed. A different element that sometimes is confused with a One Arm Planche is a "One Arm Airbaby".
* **One Arm Airbaby**, like the one arm planche, is also a balance element on one arm with the body in a horizontal position, but the body is turned sideways and it is considered a base position; it was performed in the past by a chinese pair with the top in a one arm handstand on the free arm of the base. 
* **Lever**


#### Footstands

* **Footstand**
* Category A: Regular Footstand
* Category B: Standing Backbends/Arch
* Category C: One footed Stands
* Category D: Scorpions
* Category E: Standing Splits
* Category F: Needles
* Categorg G: One footed Backbends/Arches


### Mounts

* **Climb-up**, climbing from the floor over the legs of the base on the shoulders of the base. 
* **Shoulder-Jump**, a jump into Handstand from standing on the shoulders of the Base. A variation is the One-Arm Shoulder-Jump, where the top jumps from the shoulders of the base unto one arm of the base.
* **Shoulder-Press**, a press into Handstand from standing on the shoulders of the base.
* 
* 
* **Jump-up**, ...
* **Podsechka**
* **Inlocate**, another name for Podsechka commonly used in english-speaking countries. We do not recommend to use it since it is not descriptive for the element. See Podsechka.
* **Cut-Back**, a better translation of Podsechka that is rarely used. See Podsechka.
* **Drag-Up**
* **Dislocate**
* **Cannonball**, see Capriol.
* **Capriol**, ...
* **Diamidov**, sometimes shortened to "Diamid", is a mount similar to the Podsechka, but with one hand rotated as in the Dislocate, in order for the top to be able to release the second hand and perform a 360° rotation on one arm before catching it with the second hand again. An advanced variation is the Diamidov to One Arm, where the second hand is released during the acceleration and the rotation is performed without regripping the second hand; it is especially difficult due to the tendency of over-rotation. Another advanced variation is to turn the hands additionally in to enable a Diamidov with a 720° turn, which is very rarely performed; exceptional shoulder and wrist mobility and stability are required.

## Individual Work

### Flexibility

* **Splits** are a flexibility display and a position in which the legs form one line with the hips in the middle; the legs being 180° apart, either by sitting in a split or by actively holding the legs apart; Splits can be performed frontal (one leg forwards - in flexion - and one leg backwards - in extension) or sagittal, with both legs to the side (in abduction), thus being differentiated in *Front Split* and *Side Split*. The Side Split is also known as *Middle Split*, *Horizontal Split* or *Sagittal Split*.  
In German the Front Split is known as "Frauenspagat" (Women's Split), while the Side Split is known as "Herrenspagat" or "Männerspagat" (Men's Splits) based on antiquated rules in gymnastics according to which Girls were not allowed to perform Side Splits as it was considered inappropriate to sit with legs apart. 
A Split with the legs apart wider than 180° is called an *Oversplit* (German: Überspagat). 
* **Bridge**
* **Backbend**
* **Pike** 
* **Pancake**

### Leaps & Jumps

* **Butterfly Kick**, short **B-Kick**, ...
* **Butterfly Twist**, short **B-Twist**, ...
* **Split Leap**, see Grand jeté.
* **Grand jeté**, "great jump", is a frontal split jump, in which the legs are thrown into a frontal split during the flight phase. An advanced variation is a split leap with a 180° rotation, which is called ... .
* **Scissor Leap**, a jump where both legs are thrown straight up in front of the upper body, but not at the same time, but after another, crossing each other in the middle; an advanced variatiom is a Scissor Leap with 180° rotation, which is also known in Ballet as the "Grand Jête". 
* Straddle Jump
* Piriouette Jump
* 540°
* ...


## Conditioning

* (Body) Shaping
* **Arch Body Hold**
* **Hollow Body Hold** or **Dish**. In German it is called "Schiffchen", which is a diminutive form of "Schiff" (boat), meaning "little boat"; it is described as such due to the curved shape which reminds of the shape of a boat with the lower back, which rests flat on the floor as the deepest position (like the lowest point of the boat below the water). The hollow body is a crucial position to master especially for handstands. A specific utilisation of the "Hollow Body" Shape are "Hollow Body Rocks", which consists of holding a hollow body shape while rocking back and forth. Another common utilisation of the hollow body are transitions from Hollow to Arch (and Side Arch) Body Holds by rolling over the side.
