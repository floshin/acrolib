## Acrobatics

* **Acro**, short for *Acrobatic Gymnastics*
* **Acrobat**, a person that practices and/or performs Acrobatics and/or competes in Acrobatic Gymnastics in particular. 
* **Acrobatics**, literally "walking on tip toes", generally describes movement that is especially elegant and virtuous, including high degrees of balance, dynamics, flexibility and strength as well as a performance art of displaying these acrobatic moves in the context of shows or competitions in Acrobatic Gymnastics. "Acrobatic" is assigned as an attribute to connote extraordinary physical control. "Acrobatics" is a wide term that contains many different disciplines.
  * **Floor Acro** consists of acrobatic motions that are performed individually on the floor.
  * **Aerial Art** are all forms of acrobatics performed on some kind of apparatus in the air (e.g. Aerial Straps, Silks, Hoop, Trapeze, Chinese Pole etc.), which can be done individually or with a partner.
  * **Equilibristic** are all forms of acrobatics that require an extraordinary skill to balance; most commonly expressed in form of handbalancing. But there is also the art of headbalancing and other forms.
  * **Contortion** is an acrobatic discipline that focuses on the display of extreme degrees of flexibility, often shown by genetically gifted girls or women, often combined with handbalancing. In Germany Contortionists were often generally described as "Schlangenmenschen" (snake humans) due to their seemingly unlimited ability to bend their bodies. 
  * **Object manipulation** is acrobatics performed with some kind of object, for instance different forms of Juggling or Freestyle Skateboarding.
  * **Hand to Hand** is a particular category of partner acrobatics without any apparatus and without any objects, where the acrobats (at least two) perform acrobatic feats with each other on the floor; it is the only category of acrobatics that is codified in *Acrobatic Gymnastics* in form of the three disciplines: Duo (2), Trio (3) and Group (4). Hand to Hand is also shown in Circus Shows, but is not as widely known and not as frequently performed on stage as other acrobatic disciplines. 
* **Acrobatic Gymnastics** is one of the official gymnastic disciplines of the FIG (Federation Internationale de Gymnastique), that is focused on partner acrobatics on the floor, hand to hand. Acrobatic gymnasts also perform handbalancing (on their partners) on a high level as well as contortion and floor acrobatics to some degree.  
* **Element**, .... Elements can either be performed on their own in seperation or be part of a *Sequence*. Balance elements can be seemlessly connected via *Motions*. Dynamic elements can be seemlessly connected via *Links*.

#### Handstands

* **Handstand**
* **HS**, shortcut for "Handstand".
* **Inversion**
* Category A: "Normal" Handstands
* Category B: Arch Handstands, ..., an Arch of more than X° is called a Deep Arch.
* Category C: Piked Handstands, also called L-Handstands, since the body forms an inverted L, in english most often called "Seven", since the body has the form of a "7". A variation of the Seven is the "4", which is like a seven, but with one leg bent, resulting in a shape remeniscient of the "4".
* Category D: Flags, ... A Flag with the legs oriented downwards in an angle of 30-45° is called a Deep Flag.
* Category D1: Gripped Flags
* **Figa** is a One Arm Handstand from the category of piked handstands with a 45° rotation of the back with the legs held horizontally to the floor. A Figa where the back is twisted so much that the legs are not oriented sideways but behind the body we refer to as an Over-Figa. A Figa in which the legs are not held horizontally but pointing downwards as in a "Deep Pike" (Visulka or Icycle), we refer to as a "Deep Figa". Both Over-Figa and Deep-Figa are not yet categorized as unique handstands in the ToD. 
* Uncategorized Handstands:
  * **Visulka / Deep Pike / Icycle**
  * **Over-Figa**


##### Supports

* **Supports** are categorized in the ToD among "miscellaneous elements". We are suggesting to describe them as supports and consider them as a subcategory of handstands, since they are also performed on hands and have been termed as Supports in artistic gymnastics. A support is thereby defined as a balance element that is held on hands, but in which the upper body is *not* in an inverted position, as in regular handstands, and not held above the shoulders, but either in a more or less neutral upright position or in a horizontal position and anything between. 
* **Front Support** is a position where the top is supported in hand to hand with the base, with the legs hanging down, slightly held in front, as in a *Hollow Hang*, with the body held in a hollow shape. The front support is not an element in itself, but a possible starting position for a mount (e.g. for a *Podsechka from Front Support* instead of from the floor, see mounts) as well as a transitional position that the partners move through during a Podsechka as well as during Diamidov or Dislocates. Usually performed on bent arms, but is also done on straight arms (e.g. when preparing for Podsechka or for Tempos performed to learn Hand to Hand throws), making it a fundamental position to master for pairs. The name is derived from the Front Support as performed on rings. In German I have termed it "Vorstütz" (meaning being supported in the front of the base).
* **Back Support**, similar to the Front Support, but held in the back of the base on straight arms, the feet hanging down behind the head of the base, touching the bases upper back, likewise with the top holding a hollow shape. It is not considered an element in itself, but is used as a starting position e.g. to lift the legs into a Straddle Support or to lift into a handstand with momentum of the base. Just as the front support it is a fundamental position to master for pairs, by which the base can develop the necessary stability on straight arms due to the lower centre of mass, resulting in easier balance. It is therefore commonly used as a preparatory step before attempting support holds with a higher centre of mass, such as Straddle Supports. In German I have termed it "Rückstütz", as it is supported behind or "in the back" (Rücken) of the base. 
* **Tuck-Support** is a preparatory element held on the hands with the body in a vertically tucked up position (not in a horizontally tucked up position, which would be a tuck planche). Less precisely it is described as a "Tuck Sit", which we prefer to name a similar position if actually seated on the floor. The tuck support is not given value but obviously should be mastered before attempting L- or Straddle-Supports.   
* **L-Support** is a balance element held on the hands with the body in an L-Shape, where the upper body is in a vertical position and the legs are held straight and at least horizontally to the floor. Commonly also called L-Sit, which we prefer to name the position in which one is actually sitting on the floor. Another name for this element is "Pike Lever", as the body is held in a piked position. We do not prefer this description, because the body can be held in a piked position in these three different ways; a V-Support would also be a piked lever, just as the Visulka as the other extreme. Therefore we would choose "Pike Levers" as a categorisation of different Support Holds in a piked position. There are two variations and progression forms of the L-Support which are both useful and important for higher level skills: 
   * **Advanced L-Support with higher hips**, where the legs are horizontally to the floor, but both the hips and legs are in more distance to the floor, e.g. at the elbow level. This progression develops the necessary compression strength for L-Press to Handstand on the floor.
   * **Advanced L-Support with higher feet**, where the legs are not held horizontally, and the hips are not raised significantly compared to a basic L-Support, but the feet are raised significantly higher, away from the floor in an upward angle. This progression leads towards the V-Support.  
* **V-Support** ...
* **Manna**, "Over-Support" or Russian Lever
* **Crocodile**, short *Croc*, also described as an "Elbow Lever", is a support hold on bent arms with the body is held horizontally but resting on one or both elbows. 
* **Elbow Lever**, see Crocodile.
* **Bent Arm Planche** is a Planche/Horizont on bent arms; it looks similar to a Croc on both elbows, but in difference to the Croc the body is not supported on the elbows but freely between the arms, at most supported by the arms by squeezing the elbows together against the body inbetween them; it requires significantly more strength than a Croc. It is not considered an Element in Acro but it is an important position to master in the development of the Planche and the lowest position both in the [Planche-Push-up]() as well as in the [90° Push-up](). 
* **Planche** is a balance on two hands on completely straight arms and the body held horizontally to the floor; to keep the Centre of Mass at about the hips above the wrists, the shoulders are leaning significantly forward beyond the wrists, which requires significant shoulder and wrist strength. The wrist flexibility requirements and pressure is much higher on the floor than when performed in H2H, because of the different wrist angles, that can be held much more neutral in H2H. Due to excessive strength requirements the element is also called "Krafthandstand" in German, meaning "Strength Handstand". Another German name for the element is "Stützwaage" (Scale Support) or just "Waage" (Scale) due to the body being held evenly like a balanced scale. In Russian the element is described as an horizontal Handstand, short *Horizont*, which we consider the most descriptive term, therefore we suggest using it. In English the element is most commonly known as a "Planche", which is confusing insofar as that the word has basically the same meaning as "Plank" too, which doesn't require any balance; it just describes the rigid body common to both positions. A Horizont with the hands being apart by at least three times the shoulder width is called a Wide Planche. A Planche where the Arms are completely in a horizontal line alongside the body is called a "Maltese" or "Deep Planche". 
* **One Arm Planche** is a planche or Horizont on one arm. According to the ToD of the FIG a one arm planche *cannot* be performed. One arm planches as done in Calisthenics are not considered planches by gymnastic standards due to bent arms and other technical shortcomings. The element is said to be impossible because it is assumed that it can either only be performed with a bent arm and/or with the body heavily twisted or not completely horizontal; in the past and for many years the only person known who came close to a clean one arm planche was a handbalancer called [Professor Paulinetti](), who performed it like this; as can be seen the arm is very visibly bent. In recent years some handbalancers such as ??? and calisthenics athletes such as [Valentin Blanc]() have shown cleaner one arm planches with an almost straight arm, but still a microbend remains. We think that it might be possible that in the future the possibility of one arm planches may have to be reconsidered, but the difficulty is so extreme that it is unlikely to be performed. A different element that sometimes is confused with a One Arm Planche is the "One Arm Airbaby".
* **One Arm Airbaby**, like the one arm planche, is also a balance element on one arm with the body in a horizontal position, but the body is turned sideways and it is considered a base position; it was performed in the past by a chinese pair with the top in a one arm handstand on the free arm of the base.

#### Footstands

* **Footstand**
* Category A: Regular Footstand
* Category B: Standing Backbends/Arch
* Category C: One footed Stands
* Category D: Scorpions
* Category E: Standing Splits
* Category F: Needles
* Categorg G: One footed Backbends/Arches


#### Base Positions

* **Base Position** is the position of a base during the performance of an element, e.g. while holding the top in a static hold, including the particular bases of support. Due to the plethora of possible positions it is difficult to categorise them. The ToD mostly differs them into these categories:
  1. Balance on two bent arms or on the head + one arm
  2. Balance on feet
  3. Balance on two straight arms
  4. Balance on one bent arm
  5. Balance on two straight arms, knotted hands
  6. Balance on the head
  7. Balance on one arm
  8. Balance on one foot
  9. ....



#### Motions

* **Motion** is a change of position, going from one position to another. Motions are differentiated into *Base Motions* and *Top Motions*. An example for a base motion is to move from a standing position into a sitting position while holding the partner in a handstand. An example for a top motion is to move from a straight handstand into an arched handstand while standing on the hands of the base. In German a motion is called a "Verwandlung" (transformation). 

* **Base Motions** are changes of position of the base partner or partners while performing a partner element (e.g. while holding the top). There are douzens of base motions and many do not have any common term to describe them yet. I am suggesting the following terms:  
  * **Sit-Down**, getting from a standing position into a seated position.
  * **Stand-Up**, getting from a seated position into a standing position.
  * **Kneel-Down**, getting from a standing position into a kneeling position. 
  * **Lunge-Up**, getting from a kneeling position through a lunge into a standing position. 
  * **Sit-Up (Base-Motion)**, getting from a lying position into a seated position.
  * **Lie-Down**, getting from a seated position into a lying position.
  * **Get-Up**, getting from a lying position into a standing position (e.g. as done in a Turkish-Get-up).
  * **Split-Slide**, sliding from a standing position into a frontal splits (*Front Split Slide*) or side splits (*Side Split Slide*).
  * **180°** in the context of base motions is a motion performed with a 180° turn of the body. For instance: Standing, then turning to face the other direction while kneeling down, would be a *180° Kneel-Down*. 
  * **270°**, see 180°.
  * **360°**, see 180°. The 360° is most commonly done with a Sit-Down, resulting in a very complex motion of performing a full turn while sitting down, therefore called *360° Sit-Down*, which can be and is done in various styles in different acrobatic schools. I am distinguishing the following major techniques:
     * Yaroslavl Style: This technique is used most famously by Aleksandr Kurennoi from the Yaroslavl School in Russia; first with his partner Anna Ivaseva, later with Anastasia Gorbatyuk. The major characteristic is that it is done through a wide and deep lunge without ever kneeling down, then as soon as possible straightening the front leg to move it into the seated position; the focus on the wide lunge and the straight lines makes it a very elegant style. 
     * Gurgenide Style: ...
     * Sinyavskaya Way: ...
     * Israelian Style: ...
  * **Roll-Down** is an advanced base motion only possible with the top held in one arm, which is a transition from standing or kneeling to lying through a forward roll, while keeping the balancing arm overhead, which requires extraordinary shoulder stability and strength. In its easiest forms it is done with the top held at the leg in a lying split or scorpion, which doesn't require much balance from the base; in its most extreme form it is done with the top in a one arm handstand, which requires tremendous balancing skill. While being hard, the opposite motion, the *Roll-Up*, is much harder to do.
  * **Roll-Up**, a base motion from lying to kneeling and eventually standing (but one can also move to a different position after reaching the half-kneeling position, e.g. sliding into splits); it is basically a reversed *Roll-Down* and significantly more difficult. 
  * **Turn-Around** is a motion in which the base holds the top in his hands in a lying position and turns around sideways either from *prone* to *supine* or from *supine* to *prone* (in other words: from belly to back or from back to belly), whereas in the prone position the arms are always bent, while in the supine position the arms can be bent or straight and have to be straightened to some degree during the motion.
  * 


* **Top Motions**
  * **Press Handstand** or **Press to Handstand**, short "Press HS" is a press from a standing position into a Handstand. Can either be performed through straight-straddled legs, which is called a *Straddle Press*, through tucked-closed legs, which is called a *Tuck Press*, through half-tucked-straddled legs, which we call a *Frog Press* or through straight-closed legs, which we call a *Pike Press*.
  * **Spichag** is the russian name for pressing to handstand from a straddle support, in English it is called "Stalder Press" by some and "Endo" by others, due to a different usage in artistic gymnastics. In German it is called "Aufgrätschen" (literally "Straddle-Up").
  * ...


### Dynamics

* Dynamic
* Dynamics
* **Link** is the technical term for when two dynamic elements are fluidly performed in immediate succession, without pausing and without a "reset", e.g. by a re-adjustment step or an additional squat/plié or any other initiation of force from zero. For instance: When catching a *Salto* back into *F2H*, decelerating the top through a squat, it would be a link if another salto is thrown from F2H by accelerating from the bottom of that very squat; it would not be a link if the first Salto is catched and the Base straightens the legs first and only throws the second Salto by squatting down again. This way a link can be part of an *Element Sequence*, but a sequence does not necessarily contain any link.


### Mounts

* **Climb-up**, climbing from the floor over the legs of the base on the shoulders of the base. 
* **Shoulder-Jump**, a jump into Handstand from standing on the shoulders of the Base. A variation is the One-Arm Shoulder-Jump, where the top jumps from the shoulders of the base unto one arm of the base.
* **Shoulder Jump to Head**, a variation of the shoulder jump, often performed by Mens Pairs and Groups, where the top jumps sideways from the shoulder of the Base with one leg, swinging the other leg, into a One Arm on the Head of the Base.
* **Jump-up to Back Support** is a jump of the top from behind the base into *Back Support*.
* **Shoulder-Plank-Up** is a mount in which the top is lying on one shoulder of the base with the hips, facing down, in H2H; the base performs a squat with a short, explosive upward motion in order for the top to use the momentum to move up into H2H. 
* **Shoulder Press (HS)**, a press into Handstand from standing on the shoulders of the base.
* **Jump-up** is a mount where the top jumps from behind of the base, from the base's calves, close to the knee, unto the shoulders or immediately into H2H.
* **Lift-up** is a mount where base and top are facing each other and hold their hands as for a Climb-Up, but instead of climbing, the base squats down and lifts the top from in front of him into a *Back Support* or any other support via a half turn around his body; the weight of the top is thereby held mostly on one arm only, while the other arm helps to stabilise the move.  
* **Podsechka** is a mount where the top is standing in front of the base, both facing the same directions, holding hands behind the back of the top. The base squats down, while the top jumps; they first move through a front support and then either by using the momentum of the base or by strength or by a combination of both the top moves her legs through the arms of the base and into a handstand. There are different variations of podsechkas. The easiest variation is performed with bent legs, tucking through the arms of the base and into the handstand, which gives the least value. The variation seen most commonly is performed with straight legs which are pulled through the arms of the base, over the base's head, then opened up when passing the arms into or through a straddle handstand, like done in a Press-Handstand, which has to be mastered before. The most difficult variation is to perform it with straight and closed legs throughout, where the legs are kept together when passing through the arms of the base, then basically entering the Handstand via a Pike-Press motion. Podsechkas can also be initiated from a *Front Support* instead of from the floor, as well as from a *Kneestand* (same value as if done from the floor). 
* **Inlocate**, another name for Podsechka commonly used in english-speaking countries. We do not recommend to use it since it is not descriptive for the element. See Podsechka.
* **Cut-Back**, a better translation of Podsechka that is rarely used. See Podsechka.
* **Drag-Up**
* **Dislocate**
* **Cannonball**, see Capriol.
* **Capriol**, ...
* **Half Podsechka into Cannonball**, is an advanced entry into Cannonball, where the partners perform a motion similar to a Podsechka, but do not enter a handstand and the top does not move through the arms and over the head of the base; they accelerate upwards and the top moves into the tucked or piked position, in front of the bases head, then swinging down in the Cannonball and then through the cannonball motion upwards into the actual position. 
* **Podsechka into Cannonball** is an advanced entry into Cannonball, by first performing a full podsechka into handstand, but then immediately swinging down from the handstand into the Cannonball and then entering the actual position through the Cannonball Mount. 
* **Diamidov**, sometimes shortened to "Diamid", is a mount similar to the Podsechka, but with one hand rotated as in the Dislocate, in order for the top to be able to release the second hand and perform a 360° rotation on one arm before catching it with the second hand again. An advanced variation is the Diamidov to One Arm, where the second hand is released during the acceleration and the rotation is performed without regripping the second hand; it is especially difficult due to the tendency of over-rotation. Another advanced variation is to turn the hands additionally in to enable a Diamidov with a 720° turn, which is very rarely performed; exceptional shoulder and wrist mobility and stability are required.

## Individual Work

### Flexibility

* **Splits** are a flexibility display and a position in which the legs form one line with the hips in the middle; the legs being 180° apart, either by sitting in a split or by actively holding the legs apart; Splits can be performed frontal (one leg forwards - in flexion - and one leg backwards - in extension) or sagittal, with both legs to the side (in abduction), thus being differentiated in *Front Split* and *Side Split*. The Side Split is also known as *Middle Split*, *Horizontal Split* or *Sagittal Split*.  
In German the Front Split is also commonly referred to as "Frauenspagat" (Womens Split), while the Side Split is known as "Herrenspagat" or "Männerspagat" (Mens Split) based on antiquated rules in gymnastics according to which girls were not allowed to perform the Side Split as it was considered inappropriate to sit with the legs spread apart sideways; it has not (as is commonly assumed due to these two antiquated terms), any anatomical background; we are therefore suggesting to ommit these two terms, as they are only causing confusion and refer to the splits as "Front" or "Frontal" and "Side" Splits instead. A Split with the legs apart wider than 180° is called an *Oversplit* (German: Überspagat). 
* **Bridge**
* **Backbend**
* **Pike** 
* **Pancake** 


### Agility

* ...


### Statics

* **Statics** are basically Balance Elements but held individually. All the handstands, footstands and support holds can be performed as individual static holds too (see [Balance](#Balance). But there are a few static holds which are only or mostly performed individually and not or rarely on partners, such as Forearmstands, Headstands or Cheststands. Additionally we will also list static holds that are not considered as elements in acrobatic gymnastics, but that are useful in course of the development of said elements and are therefore commonly used (or ought to be used as we think) in the strength and balance development of athletes, such as diverse yoga positions.
* **Frogstand**, Sanskrit "Bakasana", ...
* **Crowstand**, Sanskrit "Kakasana", ...
* **Tuck Planche**, Sanskrit "Lolasana", ...
* **Entry** refers to a specific way of entering a position on your own, such as a handstand (when entering a position on a partner, it is called a [Mount]()). We are suggesting to distinguish between dynamic entries and strength entries, where an example for a dynamic entry into handstand would be to jump or swing into it, while an example for a strength entry would be a press to handstand. 


### Tumbling 

* **Round-Off**
* **Rondat**, see Round-Off
* **Salto**, ...
* **Tuck**, ...
* **Piked**, ...
* **Straight**, ...


## Dance

* **Dancing Styles**, different styles of dancing. A very particular characteristics of Acro, which contributes to the amount of creativity in the sports, is the incorporation of diverse different styles of dance. There are no rules in which way one has to dance in ones compositions (other than forbidding obscene moves). This enables acrobats and coaches to utilise all kinds of styles as they wish and deem fitting, mixing traditional and modern forms, from folklore to ballett or even hip hop (if excluding the aspects considered as obscene). The styles most commonly seen are Contemporary and Acro Dance, mixed with various partner lifts from different traditions, which are rewarded by the rules as they are one way of expressing partnership between the athletes, floor acrobatics and choreographic jumps or "leaps". We therefore include the most important dance terms from Ballett, Contemporary, Acro Dance and other traditions of moves that are most commonly seen in Acro. 
* **Adagio**, is a particularly way of dance or choreography in which the partners move very slowly and gracefully to create a specific mood and tension, often utilised in Duo show acts. Adagio is rarely ever seen in Acro compositions because the short time window of 2min to 2min 30s make this style more or less impossible.

### Leaps & Jumps

* **Butterfly Kick**, short **B-Kick**, ...
* **Butterfly Twist**, short **B-Twist**, ...
* **Split Leap**, see Grand jeté.
* **Grand jeté**, "great throw", is a frontal split jump, in which the legs are thrown into a frontal split during the flight phase. An advanced variation is a split leap with a half turn, see *Grand jeté en tournant*.
* **Grand jeté en tournant**, "Great throw and turn", is a *Grand jeté* with a half turn (180° twist). 
* **Scissor Leap**, a jump where both legs are thrown straight up in front of the upper body, but not at the same time, but after another, crossing each other in the middle; an advanced variatiom is a Scissor Leap with 180° rotation, which is also known in Ballet as the "Grand Jête". 
* **Straddle Jump** ...
* **Piriouette Jump** ...
* **540°** ...

## Exercises

* **Exercises** are seen here as movements performed to condition the body, drill specific skills or to build strength, individually or with the partner(s), thus being conditioning, skill or strength exercises, as well as exercises for flexibility development.

* (Body) Shaping
* **Arch**, ...
* **Hollow**, ...
* **Side Arch**, ...
* **Arch Body Hold**
* **Hollow Body Hold** or **Dish**. In German it is called "Schiffchen", which is a diminutive form of "Schiff" (boat), meaning "little boat"; it is described as such due to the curved shape which reminds of the shape of a boat with the lower back, which rests flat on the floor as the deepest position (like the lowest point of the boat below the water). The hollow body is a crucial position to master especially for handstands. A specific utilisation of the "Hollow Body" Shape are "Hollow Body Rocks", which consists of holding a hollow body shape while rocking back and forth. Another common utilisation of the hollow body are transitions from Hollow to Arch (and Side Arch) Body Holds by rolling over the side.
* **Plank** is a static position on all fours with straight legs. We refer to a Plank as the position performed on straight arms. When performed on the elbows we refer to it as an *Elbow Plank*. It is a crucial position to master and condition to prepare the wrists and develop static tension in the core. It is also the upper position of a Push-up. The lower position of a Push-up we refer to as a *Bent-Arm Plank*. 
* **Reverse Plank** is like a Plank but in reverse, by facing upwards. When the same is done with bent legs instead of straight, it is called a *Table*. 
* **Table** is a static position on all fours, but facing upwards, with the legs bent 90° and the hips and arms in extension. Some refer to it as a "Bench". It is also used as a base position in trios. Little children without training background often make a table when asked to do a bridge, before having learned how to position the hands or lacking the strength to push up from this position. Independent from that it is an effective beginners exercise for preparation of the required hip extension and to strengthen the arms in extension; in this way it is an easier variation of the *Reverse Plank*. 
* **Push-up**, ...

* **Lying Piriformis Stretch**
* **Couch Stretch** is a quadrizeps and/or hip-flexor/psoas stretch in a kneeling position with the back to the wall. 
* **Lying Quad Stretch** is a quadrizeps stretch while lying on the back, with one or both feet under or close to the hips; depending on flexibility it can be done supported on straight arms behind the back, supported on elbows or lying on the back. When done with both legs simultaneously and wihout any kind of hand support and not lying down, but actively holding the position and hovering over the ground, it is called "Heroes Pose" (the closer to the ground the harder).

## Partner Conditioning

* **Bird Push-up**
* **Partner Push-ups** are weighted push-ups where the Partner serves as the weight by either lying, sitting, kneeling or standing on the back or the shoulders of the one performing the push-up.  
* **F2H Push-ups** means pushing the partner back and forth from bent to straight arms by the feet, in a F2H (foot to hand) position, while lying on the back; it is essentially the acrobatic version of a "floor press", but requires more stability, comparable to push-ups in rings. It belongs to the realm of "Horizontal Pushing". 
* **F2H Press** is a shoulder press with the partner serving as the weight held by the feet in a F2H position, usually done seated or standing. It requires much more stabilisation than the shoulder press with barbells and dumbbells and is thus an important exercise to develop full range stability from the bent arm position to the overhead position. When performed in a straddle or pike sit on the floor it both requires and helps building mobility, enforcing proper alignment and especially extension in the thoracic spine, just as the regular floor-seated shoulder press. It may not be used to replace work with static weights, as it is much harder to load it past a specific point, but it is highly recommended to be done additionally on a regular basis, as it not only helps to develop stability in the base, but in the top too, as well as confidence in F2H. 
* **F2H Tempos**
* **RF2H Tempos**

### About

In this glossary (an ongoing work in progress to which you can contribute [here](https://github.com/floshin/acrolib/edit/main/glossary.md)), you'll find all kinds of terms known from or associated with acrobatic gymnastics (short Acro, which is focused on the discipline of hand to hand) and floor acrobatics. 

Over time we will add terms of diverse languages and associate them with related terms from other languages in order to reduce the current confusion when talking about elements with people from another country (or even just another acrobatic school). On the basis on this research we may try to suggest a terminology, a common language, based on the most precise and most commonly used terms. We also want to add images or short animations to illustrate many of these terms. 

You can use the search function of your browser to search for terms you heard of but don't know what they mean or to search for terms you already know (you can also type cyrillic) in order to learn how they are called in other languages. 

At the moment we focus on adding English, German and Russian terms. But in the future we would like to also add Portuguese, Hebrew and other terms of the leading federations of the sport.
