# International Dictionary of Acrobatic Terms

In this dictionary you will find all kinds of terms known from or associated with acrobatic gymnastics and acrobatics in general. Over time we will add terms of diverse languages and associate them with the related terms from other languages in order to reduce the current confusion when talking about elements with people from another country or even just a different acrobatic school. On the basis on this research we may try to suggest a terminology, a common language, based on the most precise and most commonly used terms. 

We will later include a search function so that you can search for terms you heard of but don't know what they mean or to search for terms you already know in order to learn how they are called in other languages. 

We divide the Acrobatic terms into the following categories according to the structure in the table of difficulty of Acrobatic Gymnastics:  

* Partner work
    * Balance
    * Dynamics
    * Mounts/Dismounts
    * Motions
* Individual work
    * Agility
    * Flexibility
    * Statics
    * Tumbling
* Dance
    * Leaps
    * Lifts

* Uncategorized Handstands:
  * Visulka / Deep Pike / Icycle


##### Supports

* Supports are categorized in the ToD among "miscellaneous elements". We are suggesting to describe them as supports and consider them as a subcategory of handstands, since they are also performed on hands and have been termed as Supports in artistic gymnastics. A support is thereby defined as a balance element that is held on hands, but in which the upper body is *not* in an inverted position, as in regular handstands, and not held above the shoulders.

* Tuck-Support is a balance element held on the hands with the body in a vertically tucked up position (not in a horizontally tucked up position, which would be a tuck planche). Less precisely it is described as a "Tuck Sit", which we prefer to name a similar position if actually seated on the floor.  
* L-Support is a balance element held on the hands with the body in an L-Shape, where the upper body is in a vertical position and the legs are held straight and at least horizontally to the floor. Commonly also called L-Sit, which we prefer to name the position in which one is actually sitting on the floor. Another name for this element is "Pike Lever", as the body is held in a piked position. We do not prefer this description, because the body can be held in a piked position in these three different ways; a V-Support would also be a piked lever, just as the Visulka as the other extreme. Therefore we would choose "Pike Levers" as a categorisation of different Support Holds in a piked position. There are two variations and progression forms of the L-Support which are both useful and important for higher level skills: 
   * L-Support with higher compression, where the legs are horizontally to the floor, but both the hips and legs are in more distance to the floor, e.g. at the elbow level. This progression develops the necessary compression strength for L-Press to Handstand on the floor.
   * L-Support with higher feet, where the legs are not held horizontally, and the hips are not raised significantly compared to a basic L-Support, but the feet are raised significantly higher, away from the floor in an upward angle. This progression leads towards the V-Support.  
* V-Support
* Manna, "Over-Support" or Russian Lever
* Planche


#### Footstands

* Footstand
* Category A: Regular Footstand
* Category B: Standing Backbends/Arch
* Category C: One footed Stands
* Category D: Scorpions
* Category E: Standing Splits
* Category F: Needles
* Categorg G: One footed Backbends/Arches


##### Levers

* Handstand
* Arch Handstands or Mexicans
An Arch of more than X° is called a Deep Arch
* Seven Handstands, also known as L-Handstands, 
A variation of the Seven is the "4", which is a seven with one leg bent. 
* Flags
A Flag with the legs oriented downwards in an angle of 30-45° is called a Deep Flag.
* Figa is a One Arm Handstand with a 45° rotation of the legs held horizontal to the floor
A Figa where the back is twisted so much that the legs are not oriented sideways but behind the body is called an Over-Figa. 
* One Arm Handstand


* Footstand
* Support or Lever

* Straddle Sit or Straddle Support
* L-Sit or L-Support
* V-Sit, V-Support or Russian Lever 
* Manna 
* Planche is a lever 
A Planche with the hands being apart in at least about 3 times the shoulder width is called a Wide Planche. 
A Planche where the Arms are completely in a horizontal line alongside the body is called a Maltese.



## Individual Work

### Flexibility

* Splits are a flexibility display and a position in which the legs form one line with the hips in the middle; the legs being 180° apart, either by sitting in a split or by actively holding the legs apart; Splits can be performed frontal (one leg forwards - in flexion - and one leg backwards - in extension) or sagittal, with both legs to the side (in abduction), thus being differentiated in *Front Split* and *Side Split*. The Side Split is also known as *Middle Split*, *Horizontal Split* or *Sagittal Split*.  
In German the Front Split is known as "Frauenspagat" (Women's Split), while the Side Split is known as "Herrenspagat" or "Männerspagat" (Men's Splits) based on antiquated rules in gymnastics according to which Girls were not allowed to perform Side Splits as it was considered inappropriate to sit with legs apart. 
A Split with the legs apart wider than 180° is called an *Oversplit* (German: Überspagat).
