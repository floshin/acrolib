# International Dictionary of Acrobatic Terms

In this dictionary you will find all kinds of terms known from or associated with acrobatic gymnastics and acrobatics in general. Over time we will add terms of all kinds of different languages and associate them with the related terms from other languages in order to reduce the confusion and find a more common language. On the basis on this research we try to suggest a terminology based on the most precise and most commonly used terms. 

We will later include a search function so that you can search for terms you heard of but don't know what they mean or to search for terms you already know in order to learn how they are called in other languages.

* Splits are a flexibility display and a position in which the legs form one line with the hips in the middle; the legs being 180° apart, either by sitting in a split or by actively holding the legs apart; Splits can be performed frontal (one leg forwards - in flexion - and one leg backwards - in extension) or sagittal, with both legs to the side (in abduction), thus being differentiated in *Front Split* and *Side Split*. The Side Split is also known as *Middle Split*, *Horizontal Split* or *Sagittal Split*.  
In German the Front Split is known as "Frauenspagat" (Women's Split), while the Side Split is known as "Herrenspagat" or "Männerspagat" (Men's Splits) based on antiquated rules in gymnastics according to which Girls were not allowed to perform Side Splits as it was considered inappropriate to sit with legs apart. 
A Split with the legs apart wider than 180° is called an *Oversplit* (German: Überspagat).
