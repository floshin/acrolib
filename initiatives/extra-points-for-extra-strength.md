# Extra Points for Extra Strength

## A plea for a change in the Rules of Acrobatic Gymnastics
 
Acro is a Strength Sport.
Since Acro, as we have described further above, is very strength-focused and has even been called "Artistic Strength Sport" (in Germany "Kunstkraftsport") in the past, the inevitable question arises, why there are no weight classes in Acro. Base partners are weightlifting humans. And in every other strength sport as well as in martial art there are weight classes in which the athlethes compete. 

To explain the reason behind these weight classes in short: There is absolute strength and there is relative strength. An athlete which weighs only 60kg but lifts 200kg is factually stronger in relative terms than an athlete which weighs 100kg and lifts e.g. 220kg. The latter is stronger in absolute terms, but weaker in the relation between his bodyweight and the external weight lifted. In the same way, in acrobatics, a 80kg base may throw a 35kg top into a triple salto with beautiful height, amplitude and technique. There may be another 80kg base working with a 50kg top, throwing her in a triple salto too. How can these two elements be judged on the same basis, if one of the bases has to lift so much more (or is much lighter himself)? 

By not accounting for this difference in any way, the Rules of Acrobatics are basically rewarding tops to be as skinny and light as humanly possible. Now, we all know about the problem of eating disorders in the sport. But we can and should also not fall into the trap of critisizing being light and skinny for no reason, because the fact remains that being lighter will always make things easier and reduce the injury risk of tops. 

As of now Acrobatic Gymnastics uses a deduction for too much height difference in order to make up for such advantages. But it is obviously a flawed solution. The height difference is not as important as the weight difference, which currently is not taken into account at all. While a bigger height difference is usually be accompanied by a bigger weight difference too, this is not necessarily the case; the weight difference between two partnerships could be the same when in one partneship the top is tall, but very light/slim and in the other the top is small, but very heavy. Thus it cannot suffice to measure the height nor would it even be necessary if one would measure the weight. /   

But it is also important to point out that Acro and other Strength Sports have a very different goal: In a strength sport it is the goal to become stronger and stronger, to move even more weight. In Acrobatics it can and should never be the goal to lift always heavier partners; if so it would finally lead us to a sport where partnerships with the most obese tops would win gold. It doesn't make sense. In Acro it is the goal to work with the partner at their given weight and to be strong enough to do so, in order to perform beautiful elements and routines. Thus, the weight is an important factor in Acro, but it is not the focus of the sport, it is just one factor we have to work with, a factor that should not decide about who will win, because not who can lift more is the better acrobat but the one who can perform high difficulty beautifully is. And in doing so, the weight of the top can be an advantage or a disadvantage in competition. And the rules have to make up for it. /   

No matter the strength involved, a lighter person will always fly higher and be easier to catch, to hold and to balance than a heavier person, which also reduces the injury risk. Exactly because it makes more things possible and makes all things safer to do, there is nothing wrong with height-, weight- and age differences in acrobatic partnerships. Thus it would be very wrong and extremely limiting to the technical height of the sport and the performed difficulty at competitons if bases would be forced to work with tops of e.g. a minimum weight and would not be allowed to work with lighter tops. But it would not be wrong, but rather mandatory, that those who work with heavier tops, be it because they want to or because they have to, are either not being judged on the same basis, or they simply have to be given extra points for extra strength - and this is the solution that I am suggesting since many years. /  
The Technical Committee may fear to cause more problems with eating disorders when athletes have to be weighted. But for one: the coaches will keep tracking their weight anyway. And most importantly: If a higher weight does not simply mean a disadvantage for the base, but a chance to stand against more advantaged opponents by receiving extra points for extra weight, the weighing can become a procedure that one can feel rather relaxed and neutral about, just as in other strength sports too. /  
As for the question of how abuse should be prevented (e.g. drinking a lot to weigh more) - all of this can be easily be prevented if weighing happens just before the start of the routine. /  

There are privacy concerns too: But no one has to be told or shown the actual weight of the partners; it suffices to show the difference in weight in percentages (e.g. "the top weighs 50% of the base"). It is this relation, not any actual weight, which would define the different "weight classes" in Acro, with the difference that these different weight classes can still compete with each other. The higher this value is, the closer the top is to the weight of the base, the more extra points will be given to the base for every balance and dynamic element due to the extra strength involved and needed for it. /  

Now, regarding actual rules. No matter the strength, the fact remains that a higher weight difference is favourable for skill execution and safety. But we may be able to find a percentage which is considered as the standard and the ideal and can be used as a guidance for the formation of partnerships. This could be a weight difference of about 50%. At this point you would neither get extra points nor deductions. It could work roughly as follows (the actual points would have to be carefully discussed):

This way, all the different partnerships with their diverse weight differences could compete with each other; very large weight differences receive a deduction and smaller weight differences receive extra points. The deduction for height would be removed. If this will lead to more partnerships competing with partners of a similar weight, it will only serve the sport, as it will much more adults allow to participate. If it leads to only those winning with much less difficult elements, just won by their extra points for weight, it only means that the difficulty of elements in general should be rewarded more, to find the correct balance over time. The goal should be to create a situation in which we see all kinds of partnerships but where those at or around 50% are favoured for safety and the display of higher diffculty elements. By not giving extra value above 80%, we could discourage from going for too heavy partnerships to reduce injury risk.

Right now we have a situation where many pairs are performing easier elements than they could and don't risk anything because it wouldn't be rewarding, since the execution is valued so much more than the difficulty. And this was done for a reason. It favours and promotes cleaner routines. But most importantly it is a big step to reduce the injury risk in dynamics. This is important. The same can be said about balance on high pyramids in Groups, which can also be dangerous. So it is good if we can keep the rules intact there. 
But for Pairs, where there is very little injury risk in Balance, it created a situation where they do not e.g. perform a Diamidov anymore just because it could wobble a bit and you could see the struggle, while seeing some struggle in Balance in Pairs is thrilling and very exciting to watch for the audience. Only if the elements are rewarded enough would we also see greater elements and motions again in Pairs.
