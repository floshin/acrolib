## Project Goal
Draft from 29.05.23 by Flosha

(1) We want to explain Acrobatic Gymnastics in simple terms.

(3) We want to create an "International Dictionary of Acrobatic Terms" to increase the mutual understanding
(4) We want to suggest a general terminology for international usage based on before-mentioned dictionary. 
(5) We want to design a modern interpretation of the "tables of difficulty" visualised by real acrobats.
