# AcroLib

An international Library of Acrobatic Gymnastics.

Work in progress by Flosha (Webdesign, Frontend, Texts, Dictionary).


## Project Goals
Draft from 29.05.23

(1) We want to explain Acrobatic Gymnastics and correct Acrobatic Technique in simple terms.
(2) We want to *visualise* Acrobatic Technique to improve the technical standards in the sports. 
(3) We want to write an "International Dictionary of Acrobatic Terms" to increase mutual understanding.
(4) We want to offer a general terminology for international usage based on before-mentioned dictionary. 
(5) Eventually we would like to design a modern interpretation of the "tables of difficulty" visualised by real acrobats. 
(6) We want to suggest reasonable adjustments and simplifications of the rules and difficulties.
(7) We want to create a platform for acrobatics philosophy that goes beyond acrobatics as a sport.
