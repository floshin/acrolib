Based on the number of hands and feet used in the balance, we differentiate between



* **Extended Mono** is a different way of describing the One on One Handstand on straight arm, that is commonly used in non-gymnastic acro circles. We do not suggest using it, because it says less with more. *Extended* refers to an extended arm of the base, which we use to define as "high", while "Mono" could either refer to one arm/foot of the base or one arm/foot of the top and does not make it clear that it is *One on One*. Also while usually being used to describe a handstand, it doesn't make this clear either, as it could as well be about a One on One Footstand or One on One Straddle Support. While obviously it will be clear what is meant by context (just as 1on1 refers to a Handstand too most of the time), when it has to be described precisely, it is still shorter and more precise to say "High 1on1 H2H" or "High 1on1 HS" (if it is about a Handstand specifically) than to say "Extended Mono HS", by which it is still unclear by the words if it is the base holding it with one arm or the top. 



The ToD summarises "Levers" as *miscellaneous elements*:

* A: Supports or Levers on two hands (Straddle-Support, L-Support, V-Support)
* A1: Russian Lever (Manna)
* B: (Straddle)-Support on two hands on top of each other
* C: One Arm Straddle Support (a one arm L-Support is possible but not listed in the ToD)
* D: Iron Cross (can be done between straddled Legs of a lying base or between the arms of two standing bases)
* E: Planches (Split-Planche, Straddle Planche, Full Planche and Wide Arm Planche (Maltese))
* F: Leg Levers in Form of Supported Splits (Front Splits would be possible, 
     but the ToD lists/shows only Side Splits/Pancakes)
* G: Not Existent: Why?
* H: Crocodile (Elbow Levers) on two arms and open legs
* I: Crocodile (Elbow Levers) on two arms and closed legs and on one arm with closed legs(?)
* J: Crocodile Splits (Elbow Lever with a grabbed front leg)
* K: Crocodile not held as hand to hand but hand to biceps

I do NOT understand why this is not solved in the same way as with the handstands. The handstand is categorised only in matters of body orientation, where legs together belongs to the same category as legs apart because of the same straight body line (but legs together gives extra points because it is harder to balance), and where a straight one arm handstand belongs to the same category as a straight two arm handstand but gives extra points for being done on one arm. But the levers have a totally different category on their own when done 2on1 and 1on2/1on1. Same with the crocodile, where the differentiation is even more confusing. 

Based on the orientation of the body in the footstand, there are different *categories of footstands*:

* A: Front Scales and Arabesques (on one leg)
* B: Standing Splits with legs to the side
* C: Standing Splits in pike (upper body bent down into pike)
* D: Scorpions (Standing Splits with upper body upright (straight or arched up/upwards))
* E: Standing Splits arched down/backwards Variations
* F: Stand on two feet 
* G: Backbends on two feet


"minor stylistic variations"





In Pairs, there are the following Base Positions:
1. Lying supine
2. Sitting
3. Front Splits top on hands
4. Side Splits
5. Kneeling/On knees, top on hands
6. Standing
7. Standing forward bended
8. In the Headstand
9. Lying Prone
10. In the "plough"/torch position, feet on the floor, top on hands with arms straight in extension on the floor
11. Plough/torch position, feet on the floor, arms bent, top on hands
12. plough/torch position, feet on the floor, top on the feet
13. lying sideways, starfish/backflag position
14. standing starfish/backflag position
15. Front splits forward bend, top on elbows
16. Crocodile top on back
17. Planche top on neck
18. Kneeling top on feet
19. Bridge, top on hip or legs
20. standing backbend, top on hips
21. standing splits, top on neck and holding leg
22. handstand top on neck and holding leg
23. standing, top on head and supported by one arm
24. sitting, top on head and supported by one arm
25. front splits, top on head and supported by one arm
26. side splits, top on head and supported by one arm
27. front support / plank on straight arms position, top on head
28. pike or straddle support, top on shoulders
29. kneeling, top on head and supported by one arm
... 

In my opinion, this whole list is inconsistent and does not follow a clear logic.
For me, what first has to be differentiated is, where the top is positioned and balanced
and IF the top is balanced at all.
When the base is just lying down with his hands or feet resting on the floor,
then there is no amount of balance at all that the base is doing in order to make this pair element work.
All the work is then solely done by the top and the base is just waiting for the top to finish. 
This is no real "pair work", it is rather individual work done in a choreographic way. 
And so it may be placed into a different category or part of the programme for absolute beginners only.

Then we can summarise many of the positions there.

* Lying supine
* Lying prone
* Lying sideways

* Lying piked, supported (plough/torch)
* Lying arched, supported (cobra)

* Sitting straight
* Sitting piked/straddled (here the top can balance on the upper arms, and the same can be done in the splits (15),
which is basically just as being in a pike but with extra value for flexibility, and pike may give more than pancake)
* Sitting 

* Standing straight (no matter if straight or bent arms - extra value), no matter if on hands or head,
if hand supported or without extra hand support -> different value for base and top. 
It is just about the position of the base itself and his body orientation. 
    -> and here this also can be done on one leg, which should give a lot of extra value
* Standing bent forward.
* Standing bent backwards.
* Standing bend sidewards.

* Splits (Front and Side Splits, but Side Splits should give extra value)

* Kneeling straight
* kneeling arched
* kneeling piked (childs pose)
