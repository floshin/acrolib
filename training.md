# Acrobatic Training Guidelines

In order to train acrobatics, I will present some guidelines that may be useful and at which one can orient oneself. They are not meant to be strict rules, but recommendations to prevent injury and to not expect too much too soon in young athletes. 


## Progression by Age/Years of Training

The FIG in its recommendations for "Long Term Performance Development of Gymnasts", presents the following progression as an orientation:

| Training Stage | Age                | Years | Frequency | Volume | Weekly  |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ----- | --------- | ------ | ------- |
| Basic Lvl 1    | Girls: 6, Boys 8   | 0-1   | 1-2x/week | 1,5h   | ~1.5-3h |
| Basic Lvl 2    | Girls: 7, Boys 9   | 1-2   | 2-3x/week | 2h     | 4-6h    |
| Preparatory 1  | G: 8-9, B: 9-10    | 2-3   | 4-5x/week | 2.5h   | ~14h    |
| Preparatory 2  | G: 12/13, B: 14/15 | 6-7   | 5-6x/week | 3h     | ~18h    |
| Advanced 1     | G: 13/14, B: 15/16 | 7-8   | 6-7x/week | 3h     | ~21h    |
| Advanced 2     | G: 15/16, B: 17/18 | 9-10  | 8x/week   | 3h     | ~24h    |
| High Performa. | G: 16/17+ B: 18/19+| 10-11 | 9-10x/week | -     | ~27-30h |

I find this rather arbitrary and the progression is not as incremental as it could and should be. There is a huge jump in volume by just one year of training difference, then a long time of maintaining that same volume before increasing it again. It is also not necessary to include more than one training a day, as it may not be practical for many. 

I will therefore suggest a different progression leading roughly to the same result. 

If one longer training session or two shorter ones are used can be decided on an individual basis and by practical considerations. 

Progression by Age: 
* 6-7y:   1-2x/week for 1-2h (2-4h/week)
* 8-9y:   3-4x/week for 2-3h (6-12h/week)
* 10-11y: 4-5x/week for 3-4h (12-20h/week)
* 12-13y: 5-6x/week for 3-4h (15-24h/week)
* 14-15y: 6-8x/week for 3-5h (18-30h/week)
* 16y+:   6-9x/week for 3-6h (25~36h/week)

Progression by years of Training:
* 0-1:  1-2x/week for 1-2h (2-4h/week)
* 2-3:  3-4x/week for 2-3h (6-12h/week)
* 4-5:  4-5x/week for 3-4h (12-20h/week)
* 6-7:  5-6x/week for 3-4h (15-24h/week)
* 7-8: 6-8x/week for 3-5h (18-30h/week)
* 16y+:   6-9x/week for 3-6h (25~36h/week)
