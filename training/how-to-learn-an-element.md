# How to learn an Element?

*by Flosha, 22.04.2025*

Here it is less about the element or skill progression that we were dealing in another article. This is about the different approaches one can take to learn any element or skill. 


## The Method of Direct Completion

The direct method consists in basically attempting to do a skill *directly* and completely, without putting any focus on specific parts of the skill, without training any of these parts in isolation. 

This method can work in some cases and especially so in skills that aren't very complex and easy to master. 

Very often, if skills are apparently attempted like this and work well, they weren't attempted directly at all if looking more closely. For example, if we are talking about a Straddle Support on High Arms just attempted "directly", it does not mean that the skill is attempted really directly and without any preparation. The top will most likely have practiced her Straddle Support on Canes many times before and the base may also have been prepared in some way for this skill, it may just not have happened consciously. Thus when the young athletes then think that they have learned the skill immediately and with the "direct method", this is not the case and there was indeed some preparation done beforehand, that they just may not have realised as such. 

But the direct method does not mean that the athletes try to do a skill directly alone and free. It only means that a skill is attempted directly as a whole, which may well happen with the help of a coach. 

It can mean, for example, that a coach puts the top directly into the hands of a lying base and spots them in the handstand before the top can do a handstand herself and so on. Or to use a more extreme example: A coach may have the goal to teach a pair a 1on1 handstand. But before the pair can even do a 2on2 handstand the coach starts spotting them in a 1on1 handstand immediately and only focuses on this whole skill, spotting them so long in that skill until they can do it on their own. It may sound stupid, but it is an effective method that can indeed work if done in the right way. 

We may say: The better you can spot and the better the athletes understand the skill, the more effective the direct method can be utilised. 

If an athlete is alone, for example if an athlete has to practice at home without a coach, or practices online with a coach where no one can spot him, the more important it will become to break down any skill into their smallest units to master them in isolation and then putting them together. Simply because they just cannot do all the many things correctly on their own, but may well be able to if the coach spots them professionally, which may mean forcing them to do it correctly at first and then being able to spot less and less and use less and less force as they become more and more able to do all the aspects right on their own. 

Thus if an athlete has an experienced coach directly at his side, there can be (not necessary must be) less of a need to isolate skills. 

Teaching a skill directly but at the same time correctly is an advanced method for those who not only understand all the aspects of a skill, but are also physically able (in regard to strength, coordination, sensitivity, subtleness) to spot it in a way that it is already effective to train it inspite of the athletes being so far away of mastering it. 

For example: A coach may fail in teaching a skill correctly not primarily due to the lack of ability in their athletes, but also by a lack of ability in himself to manage spotting them correctly in an early stage.

If we take the example of two athletes that are supposed to learn a one arm handstand on one arm: If the top herself can do the one arm very well on her own already, the coach can let her stand on the hand of the base, while the coach only holds the hands of the base and focuses on helping him to stabilise the position as much as needed. In this case it is easy to spot.

Imagine the base is well be able too but the top is not at all and she cannot hold the handstand correctly yet. Then the coach can focus on the top only while letting the base do his thing alone. But spotting a one arm handstand is already an art in itself. It requires a lot of understanding for the technique and for the body of the top. One must know where to spot, how to spot, how to correct mistakes, how to physically help the top to understand what to do by touching and gently guiding her etc. This can already be too much for many beginner coaches. 

Now imagine that neither the base nor the top are prepared for the element. In this case he would need to spot the top and the base at the same time, but he only has two hands. How to do that? It becomes very difficult, if not impossible. But not completely impossible.  
For instance: The athletes could be spotted by two coaches simultaneously and this method, if both do it very effectively, can indeed work and would then result in a very direct and specific way of learning the skill.

We also can use the help of the wall. Or in theory it would work as well to stabilise the hand of the base in other ways (e.g. by binding it with ropes from different sites like the pole of a tent). Or by standing in front of a fixed metal or wooden pole and binding the balancing arm to that pole in order to fix the position, then focusing on the top and so on. 


## The Method of Isolation

This method isolates specific parts of a skill and uses specific drills for these parts, then puts them together into the complete element. 

For example when trying to learn the handstand h2h on low arms, one may first start to learn lying footstands on low arms while simultaneously teaching the top to hold a good handstand line when spotted on canes, while strengthening the arms and shoulders of the base through F2H push ups that develop lots of stability. 

Then they will start practicing spotted handstands in a lying position on bent arms and start practicing standing footstands on bent arms to strengthen the base in this position as well as working on the F2H Press in a seated or standing position for that necessary stability. 

Finally the handstand is done in the standing position, at a point where the base, by having developed stability through the F2H and lying H2H practice will already be rather stable and the skill will work relatively fast. 

Anton Ossolodkov (an elite coach in the US, former athlete of Kazakhstan) refers to this kind of training as "NFPT": "Narrowly Focused Physical Training". It is Skill Training in which a narrow focus is laid on specific parts of skills that the athletes are either already doing or in the process of learning.
