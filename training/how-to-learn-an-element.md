# How to learn an Element?

*by Flosha, 22.04.2025*

Here it is less about the element or skill progression that we were dealing in another article. This is about the different approaches one can take to learn any element or skill. 

(1) **The Direct Method:** The direct method consists in basically attempting to do a skill *directly* and as a whole, without putting any focus on specific parts of the skill, without training any of these parts in isolation. This method can work in some cases and especially so in skills that aren't very complex and easy to master. But very often, if skills are apparently attempted like this and work well, they weren't attempted directly at all if looking more closely. For example, if we are talking about a Straddle Support on High Arms just attempted "directly", it does not mean that the skill is attempted really directly and without any preparation. The top will most likely have practiced her Straddle Support on Canes many times before and the base may also have been prepared in some way for this skill, it may just not have happened consciously. Thus when the young athletes then think that they have learned the skill immediately and with the "direct method", this is not the case and there was indeed some preparation done beforehand, that they just may not have realised as such. 

But the direct method does not mean that the athletes try to do a skill directly alone and free. It only means that a skill is attempted directly as a whole, which may well happen with the help of a coach. It may mean, for example, that a coach puts the top directly into the hands of a lying base and spots them in the handstand before the top can do a handstand herself and so on. Or to use a more extreme example: A coach may have the goal to teach a pair a 1on1 handstand. But before the pair can even do a 2on2 handstand the coach starts spotting them in a 1on1 handstand immediately and only focuses on this whole skill, spotting them so long in that skill until they can do it on their own. It may sound stupid, but it is an effective method that can indeed work if done in the right way.
