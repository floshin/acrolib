# To Balance or To Be Balanced

*Flosha, 26.05.2025*

There are two philosophies of balance, which are particularly relevant to Mixed Pairs. One approach suggests that the base should be the one who balances, the other approach suggests that the top should be the one who balances. 

In men's pairs, where the balance is most often performed in hand-to-head, this question doesn't arise. Although the base reacts with his head, the top has to be able to stand on one arm on his own. The base cannot see him and can only try to compensate for mistakes of the top. 

In Women's Groups the question does not arise either. When Balance is performed in Hand-to-Hand in pyramids, most often the Middle doesn't even look up, keeps a neutral head position and just serves as a platform for the top. The trio top has absolutely to be able to balance herself and all the elements that she performs on the partners she can well perform on canes. Many other elements are performed on one or two feet; here too the bases only act as platforms. 

In women's pairs it is often similar due to the elements performed on feet. If the top has to do handstands on a foot of the base, she has to balance herself anyway; thus it wouldn't make sense and would hardly be possible to switch to a different technique for hand-to-hand balance.

It is therefore that the question here is particularly relevant to Mixed Pairs, because Mixed Pairs are traditionally doing most if not all of their balance in hand-to-hand and occasionally in foot-to-hand, but very rarely on the feet of the base, nor on the head of the base. 

So, to repeat our statement at the beginning: Some think that the base should be mainly responsible for the balance and others think that the top should be mostly responsible for the balance. 

But what does that even mean? Doesn't have the top to be able to balance a handstand anyway? In fact - no. It is a viable question if she *should* be able to, but it is a fact that she does not *has* to be able to.

As a simple example: I am currently coaching an 8 year old girl and she can not yet do a handstand on the floor nor on canes. She might occasionally stand for 2 or 3 seconds as a matter of luck, never more. But she can stand in a handstand on my hands for 30+ seconds without us doing any steps. Why is that? Simply because she does not balance, she is being balanced by me.
