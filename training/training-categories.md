### Base Preparation

* Muscle Mass Building & Maintenance
* Isolated Skill Technique
* Strength/Power Development
* Flexibility Development & Maintenance

[to be elaborated]


#### Muscle Mass Building & Maintenance

* Warm up (Joint/Cardio/Muscle Prep):
  * 3-way Core Stabilisation (e.g. Hollow Ups, Side-Arch-ups or Side Planks, Arch-ups)
  * Glute Activation (e.g. sidelying internal rotation or banded side-steps)
  * Shoulder/Wrist Mobility and Muscular Activation (e.g. Push-ups and preparation with an empty barbell)

* Main Lifts:
  * **Vertical Push:** Press (Standing or seated), Handstand Push-ups
  * **Horizontal Push:** Weighted Push-ups or Planche Push-ups or (behind-weighted) Dips
  * **Core:** Horizontal Back Extensions, Lying Side-Raises, Full Range Sit-ups + Holds
  * **Leg Push:** Front Squats or Partner Squats
  * **Leg Pull:** Romanian Deadlifts or 45° Back Extensions

* Accessory Exercises:
  * **Upright Rows**, important for Cannonball Development
  * **Ancles/Calves:** Calf Raises (+ Single Leg) in full-range for preparing the ancles 
  * **Wrists:** Barbell Wrist Curls, Phalanx Grip Hangs, False Grip Hangs for wrist prep
  * **Unilateral Leg Push:** (1) (Wide) Split Squats for increasing flexibility and fixing asymmetries. (2) PuBu Squats (Weighted PuBu=Cossack Squats for fixing muscular asymmetries)
  * **Unilateral Leg Pull:** One legged deadlifts
  * **Additional Core/Spine Preparation:** Jefferson Curls, Barbell Side Bends (for standing strength in side flexion and injury prevention), Suitcase Carries (for unilateral core stability and injury prevention), Pall-Off-Press + Side-Walks + Lunges (for Anti-Rotational Core-Stability), One-legged Horizontal Back Extensions + Holds or unilateral weight holds (left or right arm) in the Back Extension Hold, Stir-the-pot.
  * **Seated Pancake Good Mornings** for hip flexibility and injury prevention
  * **Kneeling Leg Extensions**  
  * **Hamstrings:** *Kneeling Leg Curls*, for particularly bulletproofing the hamstrings
  * **Neck:** Neck Curls and Extensions

...


#### Strength/Power Development

* Snatch
* Clean & Jerk
* Kettlebell/Cannonball Raises
* Any important Oldtime Lifts to add?
* Loaded Sautés (Closed leg jumps with a barbell).


#### Flexibility Development and Maintenance

* ...
* Pancake: Important for elements in a seated position, press handstands and straddle jumps. By working on unilateral pancake flexibility with an overhead-grip of the foot we are also automatically including an effective lat stretch to make sure that our lats aren't any tighter on either side.
