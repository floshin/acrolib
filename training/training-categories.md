### Base Preparation

Before dealing with the preparation of the base partners, we have to understand that there are fundamental differences between training for (1) Mass, (2) Strength and (3) Skill Strength.

All three categories of training are necessary. 

**Mass vs. Strength:** Mass training is necessary to some degree (much more important for bases than for tops), because while mass does *not* equal strength, it can be understood as *strength potential*. You are not necessarily stronger if you have more muscle mass, but you have more potential of strength-output than with less mass. To simplify (obviously it depends on additional factors): If someone with less muscle mass is stronger than someone with more mass in absolute terms, the one with less mass uses his strength potential better and the other one uses it less. After a phase focused on strength the one with more mass may become stronger and the other one will not easily be able to overcome him in strength again in lack of muscle mass because he uses his full potential already. Before he can become stronger he has to build more muscle first. Thus both mass building and strength building is necessary. They differ in volume, intensity, rep range, reps in reserve, speed, rest time, exercise selection and so on. While strength training will also be able to carry-over to more mass and mass building will carry-over to more strength, they are basically two different approaches to training. Approaching them on their own has been proven to be more effective. But some people respond better to higher intensity and less volume, others respond better to less intensity and higher volume.

**Basic Strength vs. Skill Strength:** When we are speaking of "Skill Strength" we are not speaking of Skill Training. Skill Training is simply practicing acrobatic skills. Skill Strength Training is doing skill-specific strength exercises to become stronger in the skills. To explain the difference: One may have the goal to achieve the "Planche". For doing so he will need to constantly practice specific skills that are reasonable to do at his level. This is his skill training. But the skill he aims for is yet way too hard to practice. He recognises that he has to become stronger and that his muscle mass may not suffice. Thus he will start to build muscle necessary for the skill, such as by practicing weighted push-ups or incline bench press in a mass cycle (or several ones if necessary). After (and to some degree simultaneously) to having build more mass, he will work on expressing more strength through this mass (using more of his potential) through basic strength exercises, such as, in this case, again: Weighted Push-ups or Incline Bench Press, but now with a strength focused programming, strength rep range, intensity, volume, speed and rest. After (and to some degree simultaneously) he will then focus on expressing this strength in skills through skill strength exercises, such as variations of Planche Push-ups.

It is totally possible to not approach the training in this way. It is simply a way that has been proven to be effective and is currently recommended by diverse experts in the field. But all of these exercises in their different rep ranges, speed, rest times etc. could also be done simultaneously. E.g. you could also have a mixed mass + strength programming, where you work in more of a mass building fashion a few days a week and more in a strength building fashion on other days. And depending on if one of the two is currently of higher relevance for your situation you may put more focus on one or the other (e.g. have 80% of your training be mass focused and 20% strength or vice versa). 

It is also possible to replace all or most basic strength exercises with skill strength exercises in order to have the highest specificity in training. The problem with this approach is that many skills (such as the planche or planche push-ups) are very hard on the joints and are not as easy to use and sustain without injury when practiced all the time than regular exercises such as weighted push-ups. But it can be done if one is very advanced in his level of preparation and can handle it. Thus, only using skill strength exercises for strength training is not for beginners, it is for advanced athletes with enough preparation. But it is the eventual goal in order to train with more specificity and become excellent in skill execution. 

To apply this knowledge to the training of bases: The skills that the bases have to master primarily, are tempos and landings/catches in diverse positions for dynamic, and mounts, motions and holds in diverse positions for balance.

* Flexibility Development & Maintenance


#### Muscle Mass Building & Maintenance

* Warm up:
  * 3-way Core Stabilisation (e.g. Hollow Ups, Side-Arch-ups or Side Planks, Arch-ups)
  * Glute Activation (e.g. sidelying internal rotation or banded side-steps)
  * Shoulder/Wrist Mobility and Muscular Activation (e.g. Push-ups and preparation with an empty barbell)

* Main Lifts:
  * **Vertical Push:** Press (Standing or seated), Handstand Push-ups
  * **Horizontal Push:** Weighted Push-ups or Planche Push-ups or (behind-weighted) Dips
  * **Core:** Horizontal Back Extensions, Lying Side-Raises, Full Range Sit-ups + Holds
  * **Leg Push:** Front Squats or Partner Squats
  * **Leg Pull:** Romanian Deadlifts or 45° Back Extensions

* Accessory Exercises:
  * **Upright Rows**, important for Cannonball Development
  * **Ancles/Calves:** Calf Raises (+ Single Leg) in full-range for preparing the ancles 
  * **Wrists:** Barbell Wrist Curls, Phalanx Grip Hangs, False Grip Hangs for wrist prep
  * **Unilateral Leg Push:** (1) (Wide) Split Squats for increasing flexibility and fixing asymmetries. (2) PuBu Squats (Weighted PuBu=Cossack Squats for fixing muscular asymmetries)
  * **Unilateral Leg Pull:** One legged deadlifts
  * **Additional Core/Spine Preparation:** Jefferson Curls, Barbell Side Bends (for standing strength in side flexion and injury prevention), Suitcase Carries (for unilateral core stability and injury prevention), Pall-Off-Press + Side-Walks + Lunges (for Anti-Rotational Core-Stability), One-legged Horizontal Back Extensions + Holds or unilateral weight holds (left or right arm) in the Back Extension Hold, Stir-the-pot.
  * **Seated Pancake Good Mornings** for hip flexibility and injury prevention
  * **Kneeling Leg Extensions**  
  * **Hamstrings:** *Kneeling Leg Curls*, for particularly bulletproofing the hamstrings
  * **Neck:** Neck Curls and Extensions

...


#### Strength/Power Development

* Snatch
* Clean & Jerk
* Kettlebell/Cannonball Raises
* Any important Oldtime Lifts to add?
* Loaded Sautés (Closed leg jumps with a barbell).


#### Flexibility Development and Maintenance

* ...
* Pancake: Important for elements in a seated position, press handstands and straddle jumps. By working on unilateral pancake flexibility with an overhead-grip of the foot we are also automatically including an effective lat stretch to make sure that our lats aren't any tighter on either side.
