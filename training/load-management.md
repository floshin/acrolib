# Physical Preparation and Load Management

*by Flosha, 16.04.2025*

In the physical preparation of acrobatic gymnasts, "load management" is crucial for the progress of the athletes and for injury prevention. Load management is a complex topic in strength training already, where it can be measured relatively easy; in gymnastics it becomes so complex that without substantial knowledge in biomechanics one will not really be able to understand the load that their athletes are exposed to. Among professional acro coaches the training of gymnasts is approached in very different ways. Some coaches swear by excessive planning, sometimes years ahead, including periodisation, rated perceived exertion (RPE) and lots of measurements and written records. Others aren't doing almost any planning at all, have no written record, neither of the athletes progress nor of their training programme and go by intuition day by day. And both approaches have been proven to lead to succesful results by innumerable athletes. 

The first approach, which I would describe as the "modern way", is backed by science and clearly works. But the "intuitive" and as such more "traditional" approach is not less professional. We may rather say that it requires more experience in order to be done effectively. Going by intuition should not be an approach for beginners: The less knowledge one has and the less insight into the physical and mental state of their athletes and the less one understands the synergy of specific areas of training or how to balance out the load on a day by day basis, the more trouble will be caused by a lack of planning and the more planning will be needed to prevent overuse injury. The efficiency of the intuitive approach depends on the knowledge and experience of the coach and the structure of the training. 

The two approaches are also based on two different premises and assumptions about training. 
* The "modern" approach puts more focus on the individual; it deems it very relevant what the individual feels and designs the training around it, it puts the individual first and considers training to be something that "serves" the individual. To the athletes their coach is like a service provider; they may admire him for his knowledge and professionalism and kindness and even consider him a friend, but he remains a service provider. 
* The traditional approach puts more focus on the art of training itself; the individual doesn't play much of a role, the training is in focus and the individual transcends in training. The coach is not as much committed to the athletes, but to the art. To the coach, the athletes should strive to become ideal embodiments of the art and the coach is transforming them into these embodiments like a craftsmen; to the athletes the coach is like a master working on the material of their body and they devote themselves to the art that the coach wants to express "through them" or wants them to express.

While the "modern coach" is "providing" training to his paying athletes and adjusts the training programme constantly, adjusting the work load constantly according to the perceived needs of his athletes, the more traditional coach with more focus on the art of training itself instead of on the individual, is convinced that his training programme if it is structured well enough (as he does intuitively based on his knowledge and experience), will not lead to injury independent of the constant work load, because the different training systems that his training consists of, balance out the load and keep the athletes healthy. 

The traditional coach is rigorous about the work: "The work has to be done. If it can't be done you must work harder. You won't injure your body if you balance out this strenuous work with enough additional work of "regenerative" nature, to remain healthy. It is not my job to motivate you. If you can't stand this training you can go home, as you don't have the spirit to become an Acrobat. There is no sense in training you then. I train you and give you my all, if you're willing to put in the work and give everything, no more, no less. You organise your life around the training, I won't organise my training around your life. I will not promise you to give you success in sports and I am not doing this for you or for your parents. It's about the work, the practice of the art, that both me and you are (or ought to be) commited to; success is a result of this commitment, not the goal. If you have this commitment to it, there is joy and passion in the work inspite of any hardship and tears."
The modern coach approaches, focused on the individual, may argue more like this: "I train everyone. You and/or your parents have specific goals and we agree on them like in a contract. My job is to help you achieve them. You only work as hard as your body can manage. We have to make sure that you won't do too much in order to prevent injury and I will adjust my training around these needs of yours. If my athletes don't train hard enough it is my failure that I couldn't motivate them enough. If I cannot lead them to success I haven't fulfilled my side of the contract. But as much as I may love the sports and success, the well-being of my athletes comes first and I have to make the training fit into their lifes. While I have to push them to some degree in order to make progress, it is inacceptable to train them through tears."





But there are some guidelines of self-evident character that we can point out and follow with much less detailed knowledge required and with a very straightforward approach. 

Independent of any measurements and regulation methods, there are some principles of general validity: 

1. Putting in the work. Without working consistently and hard enough, nothing will come out of it. In order to make any kind of progress there has to be consistent work and progressive overload of the work in constant, incremental steps. 
  1. In order to enable such overload some kind of recognition of ones abilities and progress has to taken place (recognising increased strength by more reps or a perceived decrease in difficulty of an exercise or by quality of movement or by endurance or by deeper angles in flexibiliy etc.). This recognition of ones abilities or progess can either take place intuitively by just remembering ones performance, perception etc. and the ability to feel ones body well or by actual measurement and tracking of performance and perception.
    * The simpler, straightforward and standardized the training is, the easier it will be to track progress and perception of exhaustion by memory and intuition. The more complex, diverse, varied the training is (e.g. doing different exercises in every training), the more difficult (if not impossible) it will be and the more obligatory measuring and tracking will become. / This makes it relatively easy for pure strength athletes. If, for example, they follow a simple programme where they are doing the same main lifts over and over again and just a few accessories and they are always aiming e.g. for a specific rep range for a time and then use a simple method like RIR (reps in reserve) to not exhaust themselves too much when training with high frequency, then it will totally be possible to have (or gain over time) a good overview of ones abilities and track ones progress by memory, enabling progressive overload without any written record. 
    * While it is very beneficial to focus on a few exercises and to practice them as long as they are still leading to more progress (both in weightlifting as well as in gymnastic skill training), and while it is also useful to do so in order to prevent someone from just doing way too many exercises without actually making progress in any of the most important lifts - we cannot change the fact that variety and complexity in exercises is very important in gymnastics. Not so much for motivation of children (which is also an important factor), but for the development of the broad basis of skills that they need as well as for injury prevention - if the same kind of load is placed on the joints in the same way and in the same angles all the time, instead of loading in all kinds of angles through varied exercises, injury risk increases. If that is the case - will we need to go the route of written records and measurement or is there another way? In order to clarify this we will at first have to consider what acrobatic gymnasts actually have to train and which kind of load is placed on them in which kind of training, which will lead us to a second principle:
  2. Very high intensity (while absolutely being necessary to become stronger) is causing damage, can lead to injury and negatively impact joint health if not managed properly and done with too much volume and may not be done daily. Low intensity with high volume on the other hand is healing, can heal injuries, can improve joint health and can be done a lot (like daily) without running into problems. The second enables and compensates for the first.  
    * If those exercises which are varied a lot all fall into the category of low intensity exercises with high volume, they will be able to contribute to healing and joint health, provide the necessary variety to prevent overuse injury and a broad foundation of movement skills and do not have to be tracked too rigidly because they will not impact recovery as much (or even influence recovery positively). In this case the high intensity exercises can be much less varied, more straightforward, with fixed rep ranges and thus be easy to overload and track intuitively. 

Another principle is this: 
* Any sudden increase in load (in frequency, volume or intensity) is a completely unnecessary risk. Load should be increased in small, incremental steps which provides the greatest safety, the least risk and makes sure that the level of physical preperation acquired rests on a solid foundation.
  * This has also and especially to be followed after every kind of prolonged period without training, such as one week of being sick, a forced stop due to an injury or a week of vacation. One week may not seem like much, but when one trains consistently 4-6 times a week for months and then suddenly not at all for a week and then starts doing so again 4 times a week all of a sudden, this will not only impact performance, it can also already lead to injury. Ideally the work should continue non-stop. The intensity of the work should be adjusted and reduced at times, but it should never stop for a prolonged period of time, where "prolonged" means more than a few days. 

* Recovery: Without proper nourishment and rest there will be no progress (or it won't be there for long and won't be sustainable). Thus, after *putting in the work*, fueling the body and sleeping well and enough is of the utmost importance for recovery.
