# Load Management

Load management is crucial for the progress of acrobatic athletes and for injury prevention. In strength training, load management is a complex topic already but it can be measured relatively easily. In gymnastics it becomes so complex that without substantial knowledge in biomechanics one will not really be able to understand the load that their athletes are exposed to. 

But there are some guidelines of self-evident character that we can point out and follow with much less detailed knowledge required and with a very straightforward approach. 

Independent of any measurements and regulation methods, there are a lot of principles of general validity:

* Any sudden increase in load (in frequency, volume or intensity) is a completely unnecessary risk. Load should be increased in small, incremental steps which provides the greatest safety, the least risk and makes sure that the level of physical preperation acquired in this way rests on a solid foundation.
  * This has also and especially to be followed after every kind of prolonged period without training, such as one week of being sick, an injury or a week of vacation. One week may not seem like much, but when one trains for 4 times a week every time and then suddenly not at all for a week and then starts doing so again 4 times a week immediately, this can already lead to injury.
