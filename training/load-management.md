# General Principles of Training Acrobatics

## Physical Preparation, Load Management & Recovery

*by Flosha, 16.04.2025*

In the physical preparation of acrobatic gymnasts, "load management" is crucial for the progress of the athletes and for injury prevention. Load management is a complex topic in strength training already, where it can be measured relatively easy; in gymnastics it becomes so complex that without substantial knowledge in biomechanics one will not really be able to understand the load that their athletes are exposed to. 

Some coaches swear by excessive planning, sometimes years ahead, including periodisation, rated perceived exertion (RPE) and lots of measurements and written records. Others aren't doing almost any planning at all, have no written record, neither of the athletes progress nor of their training programme and go by intuition day by day. Both approaches have been proven (and keep proving) to lead to successful results by innumerable athletes and keep being practiced by different coaches with distinct training philosophies. 

The first approach I would describe as the "scientific way". It is the preferred practice by the coaches that I described as being more "modern" in character in my article on the [two philosophies of training](/training/training-philosophies). The second approach I would describe as the "intuitive way" and in my experience the more "traditional" coaches are practicing it more often. 

The intuitive approach is not less professional. We may rather say that it requires more experience in order to be done effectively. Going by intuition should not be an approach for beginners (although many do it this way but fail in lack of knowledge and experience): The less knowledge one has and the less insight into the physical and mental state of their athletes and the less one understands the synergy of specific areas of training or how to balance out the load on a day by day basis, the more trouble will be caused by a lack of planning and the more planning will be needed to prevent overuse injury. The efficiency of the intuitive approach depends on the knowledge and experience of the coach (and at some point of the athletes themselves, which have responsibility too) and the structure of the training.

While the more "modern" coaches are "providing" training to their athletes and adjust the training programme constantly, adjust the work load according to the perceived needs of their athletes etc., more traditional coaches, having more focus on the art of training itself instead of on the individual, are convinced that their training programme, if it is structured well enough (as they do intuitively based on their knowledge and experience), will not lead to overuse injury, because the work load, after being developed to a specific point, stays very consistent, increasements in load are done very slowly and the different training systems that their training consists of can balance out the different kinds of load (which might lead to injury when practiced in isolation) and thus keep the athletes healthy. 

Independent of the question which of these approaches may be more effective, there are a few general guidelines, some of self-evident character, some well researched and easy to follow, that we can point out and implement with much less detailed knowledge required and in a very straightforward approach. Beyond any measurements, planning and complex regulation methods there are some principles of general validity: 

1. **Putting in the work.** Without working consistently and hard enough, nothing will come out of it. In order to make any kind of progress there has to be consistent work and progressive overload of the work in constant, incremental steps.
   1. **Ensuring progress**: In order to ensure progress through overload some kind of recognition or measurement of ones abilities and progress has to take place (recognising increased strength by more reps or perceiving decreases in difficulty of an exercise or by sensing quality of movement or endurance or by deeper angles in flexibiliy etc.). This recognition of ones abilities or progess can either take place intuitively by just remembering ones performance, perception etc. and the ability to feel ones body well or by actual measurement and tracking of performance and perception.
      1. The simpler, more straightforward and more standardized the training is, the easier it will be to track progress and perception of exhaustion by memory and intuition. The more complex, diverse, varied the training is (e.g. doing different exercises in every training), the more difficult (if not impossible) it will be and the more obligatory measuring and tracking will become. / This makes it relatively easy for pure strength athletes. If, for example, they follow a simple programme where they are doing the same main lifts over and over again and just a few accessories and they are always aiming e.g. for a specific rep range for a time and then use a simple method like RIR (reps in reserve) to not exhaust themselves too much when training with high frequency and/or volume, it will totally be possible to have (or gain over time) a good overview of ones abilities, ones physical readiness and track ones progress by memory, enabling progressive overload without any written record.
      2. While it is very beneficial to focus on a few exercises and to practice them as long as they are still leading to more progress (both in weightlifting as well as in gymnastic skill training), and while it is also useful to do so in order to prevent someone from just doing way too many exercises without actually making progress in any of the most important lifts - we cannot change the fact that variety and complexity in exercises is very important in gymnastics. Not so much for motivation of children (which is also an important factor), but for the development of the broad basis of skills that they need as well as for injury prevention - if the same kind of load is placed on the joints in the same way and in the same angles all the time, instead of loading in all kinds of angles through varied exercises, injury risk increases. If that is the case - will we need to go the route of written records and measurement or is there another way? In order to clarify this we will at first have to consider what acrobatic gymnasts actually have to train and which kind of load is placed on them in which kind of training, which leads us to a second principle:
2. **Balance Intensity, Volume and Frequency**. High intensity is necessary to become stronger, but is inevitably causing damage and can lead to injury and negatively impact joint health if not managed properly and done with too much volume. It may not be done daily. Low intensity with high volume on the other hand is healing, can heal injuries, can improve joint health and can be done a lot (like daily) without running into problems. The second enables and compensates for the first. Training too one-sided with high intensiy and low volume will not ensure joint health. Training too one-sided with high volume and low intensity will not ensure progress in strength. 
   1. **Simplicity in Intensity, Variety in Volume.** If those exercises which are varied a lot all fall into the category of low intensity exercises with high volume, they will be able to contribute to healing and joint health, provide the necessary variety to prevent overuse injury and a broad foundation of movement skills and do not have to be tracked too rigidly because they will not impact recovery as much (or even influence recovery positively). In this case the high intensity exercises can be much less varied, more straightforward, with fixed rep ranges and thus be simple to overload and track intuitively. Based on this we may categorise acrobatic training into three categories based on intensity and volume:
      1. *High intensity, low volume, low frequency, low variety:* Heavy strength training with weights or partners, just a few selected lifts. 
      2. *Medium intensity, medium volume, high frequency, medium variety:* Pair/group practice of elements, including partner conditioning like Tempos.
      3. *Low intensity, high volume, medium frequency, high variety:* Conditioning, Agility, Dance.
   2. **Slow, consistent increase in load**: Any sudden increase in load is a completely unnecessary risk. Load (in frequency, volume or intensity) should be increased slowly, in small, incremental steps which provides the greatest safety, the least risk and makes sure that the level of physical preperation acquired rests on a solid foundation.
      1. **Progress slowly after period of inactivity**: The rule above has also and especially to be followed after every kind of prolonged period without training, such as one week of being sick, a forced stop due to an injury or a week of vacation. One week may not seem like much, but when one trains consistently 4-6 times a week for months, then suddenly not at all for a week and then starts doing so again 4 times a week all of a sudden, this will not only impact performance, it can also already lead to injury. Ideally the work should continue non-stop. The intensity of the work should be adjusted and reduced at times, but it should never stop for a prolonged period of time, where "prolonged" means more than a few days.
      2. **Do not stop training even when injured, but do never train through joint pain**: When you are injured in a particular part of the body (like an arm or an ancle or a wrist), there is no need to stop training but of course there is a need to not train anything that aggravates the injury: Continuing to train will make sure that you won't loose too much strength skills, provides an opportunity to work on things you otherwise work less on (e.g. more leg work if you cannot train your arms as much) and there are almost always things you can do in training for the injury itself to make it feel and heal better. But when feeling any kind of joint pain in an exercise which is caused or made worse by this exercise, *stop* doing what you're doing. Either you did something wrong and have to adjust the exercise or you simply did too much too soon and have to back off, give the hurting joint some rest or restorative exercises (e.g. low intensity, high volume stuff) and then start loading it again in smaller, incremental steps. 
3. **Recovery**: Without proper nourishment and rest there will be no progress (or it won't be there for long and won't be sustainable). Thus, after putting in the work and working in a balanced way, fueling the body and sleeping well and enough is of the utmost importance for recovery. As a base aiming to build more muscle, imagine: If you don't eat enough you waste your time in strength training. Only if you put in enough fuel can the body use the opportunity to build more mass. Understand: It is much less common that someone is "over-training", than that one is under-fueled (for the amount of training one is doing). Thus: If you are in training and you are feeling exhausted and weak, before asking if you train too much you should ask if you are nourished enough and slept enough. These are the first and by far most important variables to be fixed. Before you haven't fixed them there is no reason to even think about less important stuff like supplementation.
   1. **Sleep Hygiene**: To improve your sleep, there are simple rules of sleep hygiene: ...
   2. **Hydration**: Do not forget to drink enough water. Just clean water. It is important in douzens of ways. For your muscles, for your brain, for injury prevention etc. 
   3. **Nutrition**: To nourish your body for acrobatics, you have to give your body enough energy. In a sports like acro you have to have access to energy fast and replenish this energy if exhausted in training; therefore carbo-hydrates serve you best (such as rice or oats or millet, properly made sourdough bread or fruit). If you feel exhausted during training you may drink or eat something that gives you energy fast (such as a drink with sugar, honey, dates, a banana or jelly beans). Other than that sports acro is very strength-focused. In order to become strong you have to get enough protein (such as from fish, lentils, beans, cheese or meat). Some fats are essential and absolutely necessary, therefore you should get some fat too (like olive oil, joghurt, cheese, butter, lineseed oil, seeds and nuts), but not too much and preferably not immediately before or during training, as it may let you feel sluggish. To get enough vitamins and minerals and for digestion it is crucial to eat enough vegetables, preferably from different colours (as they contain different nutrients) and especially so leafy greens. If you want to eat healthy, nutritious food, do not eat junk food and avoid eating outside. Prepare your food yourself in order to control all the ingrediences and to know what you are putting into your body. If you do so consistently you won't need to count calories as you can control your weight easily by the rough sizes of your portions. If you follow this advice, you do more things right than most and have done more for your recovery than any supplement can do. 
      1. **Supplementation**: To additionally assist your training and health after having met the targets above, it may be wise to take some supplements that are highly recommended in our time, partially due to changed ecological conditions or due to specific geographical conditions (depending on where you live), due to the decreased nutritional value of modern food and/or simply due to increased needs of our bodies in a strenuous sport:
         1. Vitamin C + Zink
         2. Vitamin D
         3. Magnesium
         4. Creatin
         5. DHA/EPA

## Nutrition for Bases vs. Tops

As a Base please note: If you need to gain weight and have to force yourself to eat more and have a hard time gaining any weight, it may not feel natural at first to eat more and you may wonder if it is healthy. But be aware that your perception of appetite and hunger may not work well. Many people for instance have lost their sense of thirst simply due to some prolonged or recurrent period of ignoring it. They are often dehydrated and don't recognise it. In the same way you may be underfueled and may not feel well but do not recognise it as an energy- or nutrient-deficiency because of prolonged periods of fasting or very irregular eating in the past. Thus allow yourself to eat more (maybe not more in volume, but more frequently, like adding breakfast if you usually skip it), even if it feels like forcing at times, in order to give your body the opportunity to re-adjust its sense of hunger. Compared to your top you just have to eat more. Both more carbs and more protein; otherwise the principles are the same. 

As a Top trying to stay light and lean, please note: Staying light and lean is not the same as underfueling. You can stay light and lean and still give the body everything it needs, enjoy eating and love food. Just eat in moderation. If you feel constantly hungry it will negatively impact training and recovery and won't serve anyone. The main problem is over-indulgence. It is not wrong to make it a principle to only eat if you are actually hungry and then to eat until the hunger is gone, which may mean like eating just 80% and not until you feel completely full. This simple principle combined with eating healthy food prepared at home, no junk, enough carbs in moderation and protein, a bit lower fat and enough vegetables, may already suffice to give you that light and lean body you strive for for performance as a top and still let you feel fine.
