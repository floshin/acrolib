# Load Management

Load management is crucial for the progress of acrobatic athletes and for injury prevention. In strength training, load management is a complex topic already but it can be measured relatively easily. In gymnastics it becomes so complex that without substantial knowledge in biomechanics one will not really be able to understand the load that their athletes are exposed to. 

But there are some guidelines of self-evident character that we can point out and follow with much less detailed knowledge required and with a very straightforward approach. 

Independent of any measurements and regulation methods, there are a lot of principles of general validity, perhaps the most important of which: 

* In order to make any kind of progress there has to be progressive overload in constant, incremental steps. 
* In order to enable such overload some kind of recognition of ones abilities and progress has to taken place (recognising increased strength by more reps or a perceived decrease in difficulty of an exercise or by quality of movement or by endurance or by deeper angles in flexibiliy etc.). This recognition of ones abilities or progess can either take place naturally by just remembering ones performance, perception etc. or by actual measurement and tracking of performance and perception.
  * The simpler, straightforward and standardized the training is, the easier it will be to track progress and perception of exhaustion by memory. The more complex, diverse, varied the training is (e.g. doing different exercises in every training), the more difficult (if not impossible) it will be and the more obligatory measuring and tracking will become. 

Now, this makes it relatively easy for pure strength athletes. If, for example, they follow a simple programme where they are doing the same main lifts over and over again and just a few accessories and they are always aiming e.g. for a specific rep range for a time and then use a simple method like RIR (reps in reserve) to not exhaust themselves too much when training with high frequency, then it will totally be possible to have (or gain over time) a good overview of ones abilities and track ones progress by memory, enabling progressive overload without any written record. 

While it is very beneficial to focus on a few exercises and to practice them as long as they are still leading to more progress (both in weightlifting as well as in gymnastic skill training), and while it is also useful to do so in order to prevent someone from just doing way too many exercises without actually making progress in any of the most important lifts - nonetheless variety and complexity in exercises is very important in gymnastics. Not so much for motivation of children (which is also an important factor), but primarily for the development of the broad basis of skills that they need and for injury prevention - if the same kind of load is placed on the joints in the same way and in the same angles all the time, instead of loading in all kinds of angles through varied exercises, injury risk increases.

* Any sudden increase in load (in frequency, volume or intensity) is a completely unnecessary risk. Load should be increased in small, incremental steps which provides the greatest safety, the least risk and makes sure that the level of physical preperation acquired in this way rests on a solid foundation.
  * This has also and especially to be followed after every kind of prolonged period without training, such as one week of being sick, an injury or a week of vacation. One week may not seem like much, but when one trains for 4 times a week every time and then suddenly not at all for a week and then starts doing so again 4 times a week immediately, this can already lead to injury.
