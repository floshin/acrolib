# Physical Preparation and Load Management

*by Flosha, 16.04.2025*

In the physical preparation of acrobatic gymnasts, "load management" is crucial for the progress of the athletes and for injury prevention. Load management is a complex topic in strength training already, where it can be measured relatively easy; in gymnastics it becomes so complex that without substantial knowledge in biomechanics one will not really be able to understand the load that their athletes are exposed to. 

But there are some guidelines of self-evident character that we can point out and follow with much less detailed knowledge required and with a very straightforward approach. 

Independent of any measurements and regulation methods, there are some principles of general validity: 

1. Putting in the work. Without working consistently and hard enough, nothing will come out of it. In order to make any kind of progress there has to be consistent work and progressive overload of the work in constant, incremental steps. 
  1. In order to enable such overload some kind of recognition of ones abilities and progress has to taken place (recognising increased strength by more reps or a perceived decrease in difficulty of an exercise or by quality of movement or by endurance or by deeper angles in flexibiliy etc.). This recognition of ones abilities or progess can either take place intuitively by just remembering ones performance, perception etc. and the ability to feel ones body well or by actual measurement and tracking of performance and perception.  
    * The simpler, straightforward and standardized the training is, the easier it will be to track progress and perception of exhaustion by memory and intuition. The more complex, diverse, varied the training is (e.g. doing different exercises in every training), the more difficult (if not impossible) it will be and the more obligatory measuring and tracking will become. / This makes it relatively easy for pure strength athletes. If, for example, they follow a simple programme where they are doing the same main lifts over and over again and just a few accessories and they are always aiming e.g. for a specific rep range for a time and then use a simple method like RIR (reps in reserve) to not exhaust themselves too much when training with high frequency, then it will totally be possible to have (or gain over time) a good overview of ones abilities and track ones progress by memory, enabling progressive overload without any written record.  
    * While it is very beneficial to focus on a few exercises and to practice them as long as they are still leading to more progress (both in weightlifting as well as in gymnastic skill training), and while it is also useful to do so in order to prevent someone from just doing way too many exercises without actually making progress in any of the most important lifts - we cannot change the fact that variety and complexity in exercises is very important in gymnastics. Not so much for motivation of children (which is also an important factor), but for the development of the broad basis of skills that they need as well as for injury prevention - if the same kind of load is placed on the joints in the same way and in the same angles all the time, instead of loading in all kinds of angles through varied exercises, injury risk increases. If that is the case - will we need to go the route of written records and measurement or is there another way? In order to clarify this we will at first have to consider what acrobatic gymnasts actually have to train and which kind of load is placed on them in which kind of training, which will lead us to a second principle:
  3. Very high intensity (while absolutely being necessary to become stronger) is causing damage, can lead to injury and negatively impact joint health if not managed properly and done with too much volume and may not be done daily. Low intensity with high volume on the other hand is healing, can heal injuries, can improve joint health and can be done a lot (like daily) without running into problems. The second enables and compensates for the first.  
    * If those exercises which are varied a lot all fall into the category of low intensity exercises with high volume, they will be able to contribute to healing and joint health, provide the necessary variety to prevent overuse injury and a broad foundation of movement skills and do not have to be tracked too rigidly because they will not impact recovery as much (or even influence recovery positively). In this case the high intensity exercises can be much less varied, more straightforward, with fixed rep ranges and thus be easy to overload and track intuitively. 

Another principle is this: 
* Any sudden increase in load (in frequency, volume or intensity) is a completely unnecessary risk. Load should be increased in small, incremental steps which provides the greatest safety, the least risk and makes sure that the level of physical preperation acquired rests on a solid foundation.
  * This has also and especially to be followed after every kind of prolonged period without training, such as one week of being sick, a forced stop due to an injury or a week of vacation. One week may not seem like much, but when one trains consistently 4-6 times a week for months and then suddenly not at all for a week and then starts doing so again 4 times a week all of a sudden, this will not only impact performance, it can also already lead to injury. Ideally the work should continue non-stop. The intensity of the work should be adjusted and reduced at times, but it should never stop for a prolonged period of time, where "prolonged" means more than a few days. 

* Recovery: Without proper nourishment and rest there will be no progress (or it won't be there for long and won't be sustainable). Thus, after *putting in the work*, fueling the body and sleeping well and enough is of the utmost importance for recovery.
