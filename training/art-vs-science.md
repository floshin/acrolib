Acrobatics is a Practice. It is a sports practice if it is done in the context of and for sports acrobatic competitions, if not it is a practice of a different sort. It may be a performance art, but it can also be practiced without performing at all, then it is simple a specific practice of mastering the body in particular ways and in cooperation with another. 

But what I want to consider here is not the practice but the approach to training. How one trains, how one plans the training, how one approaches difficulties in training. And I suggest that there are basically two ways by which it can be approached.

One is the scientific and result-oriented approach. The coach wants to bring the athlete from point A to point B in the most effective way, utilising all the latest scientific data regarding physiology, psychology and so on in order to do so. For this coach coaching acrobatics is like an applied science in the modern sense. 

Another and very different approach is to consider acrobatics as a traditional art and to both teach and practice it as you would teach and practice a traditional craft as if living in a culture driven by metaphysical principles more than considerations of worldly success. Even if we are not living in such a culture as a whole, an acrobatic school or community can try to develop such a culture among their own at any point in time.
