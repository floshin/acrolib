# Acrobatic Training Philosophies: Modern and Traditional Approach

*by Flosha, 16.04.2025*

Among professional acro coaches there are different training philosophies. I want to shed some light on two philosophies in particular by highlighting their differences. In some regards I will exaggerate the two positions in order to simplify and highlight their difference, while in reality some coaches may of course work and think in a more vague and less distinct mixture of the two. All coaches have in common, when doing it well, that the athletes are constantly taught to become more and more independent and take responsibility. A good coach manages to reduce his need, he doesn't just give orders, but teaches his athletes and steps away to let them practice independently and feel safe on their own as soon as they are ready. Making them ready is their craft. But other then that we can identify two approaches based on two very different premises and assumptions about training: 

* The "modern" approach puts more focus on the individual; it deems it very relevant what the individual feels and designs the training around it, it puts the individual first and considers training to be something that "serves" the individual. To the athletes their coach is like a service provider and they even may see themselves as such; they may admire him for his knowledge, professionalism or kindness, even consider him a friend, but he remains a service provider in the context of modern society, in which he considers his job as a coach as his "career" and as somewhat prestigious, embellishing himself with sportive success to gain more clients and funding. Like in a business. It is the athletes dreams that the coach makes his own and tries helping them to achieve, like some kind of salesmen seeing (or producing) a demand and trying to fulfill the need; the modern coach may also often be paid by the athletes or their parents.
* The traditional approach puts more focus on the art of training itself; the individual doesn't play much of a role, the training is in focus and the individual transcends in training. The coach is not as much committed to the athletes as to the art. They may see themselves and are seen as preservers of an art, like respected master craftsmen in medieval society. To this coach, the athletes should strive to become ideal embodiments of the art and the coach is transforming them into these embodiments like a craftsmen; to the athletes the coach is like a master working on the material of their body and they devote themselves to the art that the coach wants to express "through them" or wants them to express. It is the coaches plan and vision that the athletes make their own and act out. These coaches often aren't paid and do it for the sake of it, they're traditionally provided for in other ways, be it by a lord or by the state or by some other donors. 

The modern coach, focused on the individual, approaches training somewhat like this: 
> "I train everyone. You and/or your parents have specific goals and we agree on them like in a contract. My job is to help you achieve them. You only work as hard as your body can manage. We have to make sure that you won't do too much in order to prevent injury and I will adjust my training around these needs of yours. If my athletes don't train hard enough it is my failure that I couldn't motivate them enough. If I cannot lead them to success I haven't fulfilled my side of the contract. But as much as I may love the sports and success, the well-being of my athletes comes first and I have to make the training fit into their lifes. While I have to push them to some degree in order to make progress, it is inacceptable to train them through tears."

The traditional coach on the other hand is rigorous about the work: 
> "The work has to be done. If it can't be done you must work harder. You won't injure your body if we balance out this strenuous work with enough additional work of "regenerative" nature, to remain healthy. It is not my job to motivate you. If you can't stand this training you can go home, as you don't have the spirit to become an Acrobat. There is no sense in training you then. I train you and give you my all, if you're willing to put in the work and give everything. No more, no less. Organise your life around the training, I won't organise my training around your life. I will not promise you to give you success in sports and I am not doing this for you or for your parents. It's about the work, the practice of the art, that both me and you are (or ought to be) commited to; success is a result of this commitment, not the goal. If you have this commitment to it there is joy and passion in the work inspite of any hardship and tears."
