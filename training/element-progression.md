# Element Progression

*by Flosha, 22.04.2025*

While there is no fixed order or any kind of rule for the acquisition of skills, there are several skills or exercises that can be considered as pre-requisites of other skills or exercises, because they may teach the same patterns with less difficulty and complexity, may build some kind of base-level capacity for the skill to be achieved and ideally can be seen as didactical steps towards that skill. 

We will list these skills and exercises in sequences following each other in complexes. What we are not including in these sequences of skills is the necessary individual preparation of the partners. When talking about e.g. learning a skill like High H2H HS 2on2 it is obviously considered a given that the top can already stand on her hand in a very stable line at the wall and when held on canes by the coach. 

I divide the article in the following sections:

## Development of Balance in Pairs

(1) **Approach by F2H:** 
Progress through all these steps of F2H: Lying Low F2H -> F2H Push-ups -> Lying High F2H -> Standing or sitting Low F2H -> Standing Low F2H -> High F2H. 
Do so while simultaneously incorporating H2H spotted by a coach in one or two steps below the position you have mastered the F2H in. For instance: If you cannot yet hold a Lying Low F2H, you won't practice H2H yet. If you mastered Lying Low and High F2H you may start practicing some lying Low H2H with a coach. 

(2) **Approach by H2H Plank:** 
I am personally using a very effective exercise which I call "H2H Plank", lying H2H in a Plank position with elevated feet of the top. The Base lies on the floor with the top in H2H. The top has her feet on a box behind the head of the base, at the level of her shoulders, thus holding a plank on the base with elevated feet, while her body is straight. It can be started on bent arms of the base: Lying Bent Arm H2H Plank. Or it can be started on straight arms already, but with the box closer to the head of the base, so that the knees or thighs of the top are lying on the box. When it is mastered on straight arms of the base, the difficulty can be increased further by putting the feet of the top into rings or by using another partner holding the feet. 

(2b) **H2H Push-ups:** The next step is to perform what I call *H2H Push-ups* in this position in three different ways. First the partners perform the push-ups in isolation, the base pushes the top up, while the top keeps the arms straight or holds a bent arm push-up position. Then the top performs push-ups while the base keeps the arms straight or bent. Then base and top perform push-ups simultaneously. For the top this exercise has the added benefit of being able to perform the push-ups in a much deeper range than on the floor. 

The H2H Plank has the crucial benefit that it can be practiced independently by the partners, even children, very safely and simply, improving their stability without the need of the coach to be involved, even easier than F2H. If practiced independently F2H (in every position) is best done and secured by the top holding on to a rope or wall bars as needed. 

The H2H Plank has also the advantage that not only the base develops a sense for balance, stability in his shoulders/arms and grip strength, as is the case in F2H, where the top makes no progress towards H2H. In the H2H Plank the top is in H2H from the very beginning, has to grip hard and stabilise her arms, helping the base. But F2H has the benefit that the base holds the full weight of the top, whereas in H2H Planks only a part of the weight will be on the hands of the base. Therefore I recommend to use both of these methods. But the H2H Plank can also be taken further. 

(3) The H2H Plank can slowly be transformed into a HS by elevating the feet higher in small steps.
