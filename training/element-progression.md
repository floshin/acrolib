While there is no fixed order or any kind of rule for the acquisition of skills, there are several skills or exercises that can be considered as pre-requisites of other skills or exercises, because they may teach the same patterns with less difficulty and complexity, may build some kind of base-level capacity for the skill to be achieved and ideally can be seen as didactical steps towards that skill. 

We will list these skills and exercises in sequences following each other. What we are not including in these sequences of skills is the necessary individual preparation of the partners. When talking about e.g. learning a skill like High H2H HS 2on2 it is obviously considered a given that the top can already stand on her hand in a very stable line at the wall and when held on canes by the coach.

**High H2H HS 2on2:**
1. Lying Low F2H -> F2H Push-ups -> Lying High F2H
2. What I am personally using is a very effective exercise which I call "Partner Plank", lying H2H in a Plank position with elevated feet of the top. The Base lies on the floor, Top in H2H, Top has her feet on a box behind the head of the base, at the level of her head, thus holding a plank on the base with elevated feet, while her body is straight. It can be made easier by moving the box closer to the head, so that the knees or thighs of the top are lying on the box. With only the feet it is harder. The difficulty can be increased by putting the feet of the top into rings or by using another partner holding the feet or by elevating the feet higher.
