# Periodisation

*by Flosha, 29.04.2025*


In this article I will introduce the general concept of periodisation in strength training and gymnastics. Then I will point out a few different approaches or forms of periodisation.


## What is periodisation?

I would like to compare different periodisation methods with different approaches to diet. There is...
* a very strict diet plan, where you only eat precisely what is written on the plan, which requires a lot of planning, but may be preferred by some people. This strict method is almost guaranteed to lead to success, if followed strictly, which can be difficult. 
* there is so called flexible dieting, where the macro nutrients are defined,  but one can freely choose the food as long as he covers his macros in the end and doesn't exceed his needs, and this flexible approach works better for many people. It also is almost guaranteed to lead to success in regard to the desired body recomposition, but may contain some downsides in regard to health, since it doesn't matter what one eats, just that its the correct amount of macro nutrients. A strict plan may plan in more variety. There are ways around that obviously, like also including micro nutrient targets or by just more stricty planning in a specific amount of "healthy" options while keeping other areas flexible and so on. 
* lastly there is what I would describe as "intuitive" dieting, which is what most people do and it is also what works easiest for most people. It works insofar as that most people usually eat rather intuitively and hold their weight thereby. It is only problematic if they want to gain or loose weight and establish a new norm as athletes etc. In such cases, the success of an intuitive diet depends on how good ones intuition is or how well one follows ones intuition instead of making nutritional decisions based on other factors, such as appetite, emotional craving etc. 

In training it is very similar. 
* One can train according to a very strict plan. If the plan is bad, nothing will come out of it or one may as well injure oneself. But if it is good, gets adjusted to the individual needs etc., strict planning can be extremely effective and will almost inevitably lead to results if one strictly trains accordingly.
* Then there is a more flexible approach to programming. Just as in the example above one may only try to get the right amounts of nutrients while being free to choose the food options, in a flexible training programme one may for example have...
  * (strict volume, free exercise selection) a strict number of sets that one aims for per day or per week or per month, but is free to choose the exercises one prefers for the target muscles. Or, a different form of flexible training would be the opposite.
  * (fixed exercises, flexible volume/intensity) One may as well have strict exercises that one has to do, but is flexible in how much volume he aims for or how intense he trains the muscles etc.
* lastly there is an intuitive training, where one neither has a fixed exercise selection nor a fixed desired volume, intensity or frequency. This can be effective as well or it may lead to constant injuries and problems or simply to no progress whatsoever. 

But independent of all these different approaches there are a few factors that decide over whether or not progress will be made or not and whether or not this progress is sustainable.

1. There has to be progressive overload. If you plan it or not, if the training is meant to lead to any desired result, some kind of numbers have to go up. You have to move more weight or be able to perform more difficult moves, you have to have more endurance over time, more strength, more volume and so forth. If nothing happens (anymore) or one gets weaker or is stuck, something isn't working. But if he makes progress and keeps being injury-free, then what he is doing is working, if strictly planned, flexibly planned or intuitively unplanned. It requires progressive overload.

2. Every form of periodisation involves some sort of higher intensity (pushing harder for strength, but putting much pressure on the body and joints) and lower intensity training (focusing more on musculature, mass building and/or joint health). This can happen on a block basis in form of deload weeks, but it can as well happen in form of lower intensity, higher volume sessions vs. higher intensity, lower volume sessions that switch on a weekly or daily basis in waves. It is important to practice both. Only lower intensity may result in much endurance and healthy joints, but strength will suffer. Only higher intensity may result in much strength, but ones joint health and endurance, cardio-vascular health etc. will suffer. Thus, one has to have both, balance out both. A strict programme can do that, a flexible programme can do that and an intuitive one can do that as well.

* Intensity-focused progression
* Volume-focused progression
* Linear/Wavy Cycles vs. Steady State Cycles


## The Gentle Sinyavskaya Method

Our approach, which I would describe as my theortical analysis of the method of Galina Sinyavskaya mixed with a simple Steady State method of intuitive periodisation and progressive preparation for injury prevention (which attempts to get the same result as Galinas approach to work, just a bit more gentle and measurable), I will summarise as follows: 

(1) Progressively develop a wide, varied and high volume of work at low intensity as a foundation of muscular and cardio-vascular endurance (build up a specific amount of handstand work, of dynamic work, of balance work, of agility, of tumbling, of dance, of strength and conditioning and of flexibility). Be able to do this same amount of work consistently every week.

(2) After having established the volume and being able to maintain it, slowly increase the intensity, ideally just one category at a time, while maintaining the same volume. Do so until you reached the desired level of being able to execute all your desired skills consistently and easy enough.  
  (2a) Working hard is always necessary, but cannot mean to work through joint pain and into injury. Thus while trying to increase the overall intensity further and further be always ready to adjust the intensity intuitively on a day-by-day basis to accomodate to your level of fatigue, soreness, tendon strain etc.   
  (2b) After an injury or any other prolonged period of inactivity of more than a few days (e.g. a week or even just 3-4 days if you otherwise train 5-6 days a week), stick to the same volume, but lower the intensity roughly in half, after a while (maybe a week, maybe longer) to 3/4 and then after another period back to the full former workload.
