# Periodisation

*by Flosha, 29.04.2025*


In this article I will introduce the general concept of periodisation in strength training and gymnastics. Then I will point out a few different approaches or forms of periodisation.


## What is periodisation?

...

* Intensity-focused progression
* Volume-focused progression
* Linear/Wavy Cycles vs. Steady State Cycles


## The Gentle Sinyavskaya Method

Our approach, which I would describe as my theortical analysis of the method of Galina Sinyavskaya mixed with a simple Steady State method of intuitive periodisation and progressive preparation for injury prevention (which attempts to get the same result as Galinas approach to work, just a bit more gentle and measurable), I will summarise as follows: 

(1) Progressively develop a wide, varied and high volume of work at low intensity as a foundation of muscular and cardio-vascular endurance (build up a specific amount of handstand work, of dynamic work, of balance work, of agility, of tumbling, of dance, of strength and conditioning and of flexibility). Be able to do this same amount of work consistently every week.

(2) After having established the volume and being able to maintain it, slowly increase the intensity, ideally just one category at a time, while maintaining the same volume. Do so until you reached the desired level of being able to execute all your desired skills consistently and easy enough.  
  (2a) Working hard is always necessary, but cannot mean to work through joint pain and into injury. Thus while trying to increase the overall intensity further and further be always ready to adjust the intensity intuitively on a day-by-day basis to accomodate to your level of fatigue, soreness, tendon strain etc.   
  (2b) After an injury or any other prolonged period of inactivity of more than a few days (e.g. a week or even just 3-4 days if you otherwise train 5-6 days a week), stick to the same volume, but lower the intensity roughly in half, after a while (maybe a week, maybe longer) to 3/4 and then after another period back to the full former workload.
