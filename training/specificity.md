# Specificity in Strength Training for Acrobatics

*by Flosha, 18.04.2025 - 19.04.2025*

You become better at what you train and internalise it in the way you train it. You will as well internalise bad patterns if you keep practicing them. That makes it very obviously essential to practice, from the very beginning, in the most technically correct way. For this reason a good coach is necessary to teach and instill solid technique. 

This is the simple rule of specificity: You become good at what you do. When you do it badly you will become good in doing it badly. The same applies to strength. The more specific your strength training is to your required or desired skills, the better you will become in performing them. Therefore we are aiming to make all (or as much as reasonably possible) of our training *specific* to what it should eventually enable us to do. 

The strength requirements and skills of base and top partners are different due to their different roles in the sport. Therefore I am dividing this article in: 
* [Specificity in the Preparation of Bases](#specificity-in-the-preparation-of-bases)
* [Specificity in the Preparation of Tops](#specificity-in-the-preparation-of-tops)

But before we deal with the specific preparation of the partners and their differences, we will have to clarify some general terms and principles. If we understand these we can then show how these principles can be applied in the specific preparation of the partners. 

At first we have to understand that there are (or can be) important differences between training for (1) Mass, (2) Strength and (3) Skill Strength. All three of these categories of training are necessary, but in different ways for bases and tops.


## Mass vs. Strength

At first we will at the difference betwern Mass and Strength training and how mass relates to strength and vice versa. 

Mass training is necessary to some degree (more for bases than for tops). While mass does *not* equal strength it can be understood as *strength potential*. You are not necessarily stronger if you have more muscle mass, but you have more potential of strength-output than with less mass. 

To simplify this (obviously it depends on additional factors): If someone with less muscle mass is stronger than someone with more mass in absolute terms, the one with less mass uses his strength potential better and the other one uses it less.   
After a phase focused on strength the one with more mass may become stronger and the other one will not easily be able to overcome him in strength again, in lack of muscle mass, because he uses his full potential already. Before he can become stronger he has to build more muscle first. 

Thus both mass building and strength development is necessary. Training them efficiently may differ in volume, intensity, rep range, reps in reserve, speed, rest time, exercise selection and so on. While a strength focused training will also be able to carry-over to more mass and mass building focused training will carry-over to more strength, they are two different approaches to training. 

Approaching them on their own in seperate cycles has been proven to be more efficient. But efficiency is not the only factor that may be relevant to coaches and athletes. 

In general we can distinguish the two approaches like this:
* Mass is mainly build by lower to medium intensity and by a progression of volume; the focus lies on the pump of the muscles, thus prolonging time under tension, controlling the weight more and reducing rest time. 
* Strength is mainly build by higher intensity and by a progression of intensity (while the volume may even decrease); the focus lies on the neurological strength output; time under tension is reduced, the stretch reflex is used, the eccentric is not slowed down and the concentric done as explosive as safely possible; rest time is increased as needed.

But while this is a general scheme that works for most people, we also have to be aware that some people respond better to higher intensity and less volume even for building mass. While others respond better to less intensity and higher volume. And strength can be developed with lower intensity and higher volume too, just more slowly (but also very safely). 

If strength is increased in this way it basically means that one never fully utilises the muscle mass to his full potential and will not be as strong as he could be. But that doesn't mean that it might not be a potent and safe approach to training for some use-cases. 

This is based on two different approaches to training, progression and overload:

* Usually one may approach it by training with high intensity, gaining as much strength as possible, then building more mass, then doing another strength cycle to utilise this mass and so on. By doing so one is often close to the edge of what his body can handle with positive adaptation instead of breaking down and if he finds the right sweet spot in doing so, e.g. by diverse regulation methods, he will make progress and hopefully remain injury-free. It also may be more valuable for people who do not train everyday and who like planning and thinkering around with their programme. Planning and sticking to these cycles can be difficult and tiring and too much for many people to do on their own, when they just want to focus on training. Periodisation and training in cycles is usually something planned and provided by Coaches, so that their athletes do not have to worry about it. Many non-professional strength athletes use modern apps providing such a scheme for them instead of doing it on their own.

* The other method is very different in that it is setting a

For bases and tops we have to make a clear distinction in regard to mass vs. strength as it relates to their role. Bases can theoretically maximise mass building, depending on their other goals. There is always a trade-off in being too heavy depending on which kinds of disciplines a base is also trying to specialise in. 

For example: As a handbalancer, heavy legs are extremely benachteiligend. Trying to be a base and a handbalancer thus may mean that one may try to find a middle ground of strong but not too heavy legs. Or he may choose to keep them very lean for handbalancing but as a trade-off specialise in balance in hand-to-hand, reducing the necessary leg strength due to the lack of (higher level) dynamics. 

Being too heavy can also have negative impact in regard to elegance. There is a reason for dancers to be lean and relatively thin, as it accentuates the lines. Thus in some cases it may just be a personal choice due to an aesthetical preference and personal well-being. If one doesn't feel well in ones body past a specific weight there is no sense in forcing more weight unto it. 

But in general we can say that bases should aim to become muscular enough to be able to handle their tops *easily*. And while staying lean in the process may be favourable in gymnastics for the aesthetics in the performance, it will not really have much of a negative impact on skill execution, especially since senior gymnasts are no longer required to perform any individual elements. The ideal is to be muscular and lean, with no need to be "light".

The situation is different for tops. For tops it is and always will be crucial to be lean, but also to be light. Too much muscle won't be of use and will negatively impact skill execution. Thus, for tops much more than for bases, the ideal would be to maximise the strength-to-mass (or strength-to-weight) ratio; being as strong as possible with little/less mass. Nonetheless they have to build some degree of mass in the process of learning and mastering their skills. 

This will more so be the case if girls develop wider hips and a more regular feminine physique (in difference to the cases of those girls who preserve the physique of a girl into adulthood); in this case much more mass will be required and necessary to be build in order to maintain their skills. 


## Basic Strength vs. Skill Strength

When we are speaking of "Skill Strength" we are not speaking of Skill Training. Skill Training is simply practicing acrobatic skills. Skill Strength Training is doing skill-specific strength exercises to become stronger in the skills. 

To explain the difference: One may have the goal to achieve the "Planche". For doing so he will need to constantly practice specific skills that are reasonable to do at his level. This is his skill training. But the skill he aims for is yet way too hard to practice. He recognises that he has to become stronger and that his muscle mass may not suffice. Thus he will start to build muscle necessary for the skill, such as by practicing weighted push-ups or incline bench press in a mass cycle (or several ones if necessary). These exercises are not too specific to the planche, but they are easy to train and build a big part of the muscles involved. 

After (and to some degree simultaneously) to having build more mass, he will work on expressing more strength through this mass (using more of his potential) through basic strength exercises, such as, in this case, again: Weighted Push-ups or Incline Bench Press, which is the second step. But now with a strength focused programming, strength rep range, intensity, volume, speed and rest. 

After (and to some degree simultaneously) he will then focus on expressing this strength in skills through skill strength exercises, such as variations of Planche Push-ups, which would be the third step. 

But one thing has to be understood: If he is strong enough for the planche, so strong that the planche is easy to him and he has enough mass to hold it consistently and for long and if this is the only or the hardest skill that he wants to do, then there will be no need whatsoever to do any more mass building. He doesn't need more mass and it may even be detrimental to the execution of his desired skill(s). If the mass is build and if sufficient, it will be enough to preserve it through sufficient nutrition and through sufficient usage of strength. 

It is totally possible to not approach the training in this way of these three cycles of Mass, Strength and Skill Strength.   
It is simply a way that has been proven to be effective and is currently recommended by diverse experts in the field. But all of these exercises in their different rep ranges, speed, rest times etc. could also be done simultaneously. E.g. you could also have a mixed mass + strength programming, where you work in more of a mass building fashion a few days a week and more in a strength building fashion on other days. And depending on if one of the two is currently of higher relevance for your situation you may put more focus on one or the other (e.g. have 80% of your training be mass focused and 20% strength or vice versa). 

Or one may already have enough mass, so he has no need in wasting time on building more. 

It is also possible to replace all or most basic strength exercises with skill strength exercises in order to have the highest specificity in training. The problem with this approach is that many skills (such as, to stick to our example, the planche or planche push-ups) are very hard on the joints and are not as easy to use and sustain without injury when practiced all the time than regular exercises such as weighted push-ups. But it can be done if one is very advanced in his level of preparation and can handle it. Thus, only using skill strength exercises for strength training is not for beginners, it is for advanced athletes with enough preparation. But if it can be done safely and sustainably - it is the eventual ideal and the preferred way in order to train with more specificity for excellent skill execution.


## Specificity in the Preparation of Bases

To apply this knowledge to the training of bases: The skills that the bases have to master primarily, are tempos and landings/catches in diverse positions for dynamic, and mounts, motions and holds in diverse positions for balance. 

Balance, where it is not about pure skill training with little intensity, is primarily about overhead stability and strength on one arm (the mobility will be developed automatically if training stability and strength correctly). Thus when we want to train skill strength for balance in the *most specific way*, so that the weight of our tops will feel easy, we have to try using the next best exercises to balancing a partner. 

On two arms (1) just holding/carrying a barbell overhead - is not very specific because of the much lower centre of mass, but can be useful nonetheless. (2) Holding/carrying a barbell with the addition of weight plates dangling from elastic bands attached to the sides for extra instability. (3) Using self-build equipment simulating two arms with weight on top. This can be a metal construction with the possibility to load via plates, it also could be a wooden construct with a sort of simulated torso filled with sand bags etc. If there is not any such equipment available or not reasonable to use (4) holding other bases on ones hands in different positions can build significant amounts of additional strength and can well suffice to become strong enough that the top will be very easy to hold, if a reasonable weight difference between the base and top is given.  

For one arm balance: Holding a barbell regularly on one arm would be very unspecific due to the much lower centre of mass. What for regular weightlifters is already an exotic and cirquesque exercise that is apparently only done by oldtime strongman enthusiasts, is too unspecific for the training of acrobats. It may be done if there are no other options available. Good options are (1) balancing a barbell vertically with weight added to the top or (2) balancing heavy kettlebells in the bottom-up position, which additionally strengthens the wrists/grip necessary in one arms tremendeously or (3) using specifically build equipment that simulates the balance of a partner even better while allowing to increase the weight in small, incremental steps. The best self-build equipment for this purpose is a T-shaped bar with an angled handle at the bottom (like in blocks for tops) and the possibility to both load the two "legs" on the left and right (the horizontal bar of the "T"), as well as the centre on top and/or below the horizontal bar of the construct. This way the weight distribution of the partner in a handstand is simulated most accurately. The problem with such equipment is that they require high ceilings and that it is very difficult (if not dangerous) to get them into position on ones own (and especially getting them down safely again) if substantially loaded. Therefore they are recommended to be used with a pulley system, where the coach can help to get them into position and can help to bring them down safely. As described for the two arm preparation: If none of these options are available, the simplest solution is to hold other bases on one arm in different positions, which can well suffice to strengthen and prepare the base for one arm balance of the top, if a reasonable weight difference between the base and top is given. 

Vertically held and top-weighted barbells require high ceilings, much higher than available in most commercial gyms, where it won't be possible even when sitting down. Other than that it will of course be forbidden to do in commercial gyms due to (valid) safety concerns. In gymnastic halls one should be aware that it will absolutely destroy the spring floor (and almost any other floor) when falling down. Additionally, when the weight should fall down, apart from a risk for anyone around a rather wide radius being hitted by the weight, there is additional risk involved due to it only being weighted on one side. Depending on how the barbell lands, the un-weighted side of the barbell could be suddenly snap up upon landing like if stepping on a rake and causing serious injury. Additionally it is hard to get it into and out of position. A rather safe environment to use it in would be outside in grass. 

The solution with the pulley system is safe to use. The weight could always dangle at a specific height that is low enough for you to easily get it into position, but high enough for it to not hit you if you loose balance. This way it could be used independently when training alone. Nonetheless it requires an advanced setup and dedicated gym. 

The solution with a heavier partner is the most versatile to use. It is easy to get into position, there is no additional equipment needed, only another base. Safety can be ensured well through very simple basic provisions. And if necessary it can be done in a seated position in every room independent of the height of the ceiling. The only caveat is that it is more difficult to load in incremental steps, if there are not many heavier tops or bases of different weight available. Ancle weights and weighted vests become very useful then.
