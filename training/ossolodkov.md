# Konstantin Ossolodkov

Konstantin Ossolodkov is a former athlete from Kazakhstan, now training elite athletes in the United States, most famously the Ossolodkov Brothers, two of his sons who compete as a Men's Pair.


## NFPT

NFPT is a concept by Ossolodkov. The acronym stands for "Narrowly Focused Physical Training". It can be thought of as a part of Skill Training, in which a narrow focus is laid on specific parts that the athletes already do. 

For example: A men's pair may perform a high H2H handstand and then the top lowers down into planche. In training, apart from working on the full skill itself, drills are done that are narrowly focusing on only a specific part of that skill, such as the coach spotting the top in the lowering into planche and back to handstand several times.
