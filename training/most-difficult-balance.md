# List of the most difficult Balance Elements

*by Flosha, 24.04.2025*

Todo: One word to use instead of "most difficult"? E.g. "Elite" could be the level before. Those are even higher. Maybe something like world-class.


## Most difficult pair balance in H2H

(1) **1on1 High Arm HS:** The One on One Handstand on straight arms is the most famous and representative acro element to show balance in Hand to Hand. If done well and by high technical standards it can be seen as an advanced skill that shows serious training and commitment of both partners. 

But in the list of the "most difficult" balance elements in pairs, the 1on1 HS (while not even being done by every senior pair) can still only count as the very beginning of the skills to be mastered at this level when compared to what has been proven to be possible by a few. 

(2) **1on1 High Arm Base Motions: Sit-Down/Stand-up, Turns and Walks & Top Motions**: After mastering the 1on1 Handstand, basic motions of the base (or the top) during 1on1 are the next level to master, starting with the Sit-Down and Stand-up while holding 1on1, walking and turning (e.g. 180-360 Rotations while standing). A top motion would be to go from a Straddle HS into Svecha, Tuck or Flag. A high level of mastery in this level is achieved when both of the partners can perform their motions in immediate succession or even simultaneously. 

(3) **1on1 High Arm 360° Sit-Down and 360° Stand-up**: Combining the turns, walks and sit-downs, the base may move a step further by performing a 180° into lunge. From here he may continue to learn a 270° Sit-Down and finally rotate a full 360°, which is currently one of the hardest Balance Elements being performed by Pairs in Acrobatic Gymnastics, rarely seen even by Senior Mixed Pairs. When the 360° Sit-Down is achieved, the 360° Stand-up can be the next step to master. It is significantly harder to do and is currently not shown in competition by any Pair at the international level. It can be made additionally harder and the balance even longer by adding a table inbetween the Sit-Down and the Stand-Up as well as motions of the Top. The difference in difficulty between a static 1on1 to a 360 Sit Down in 1on1 is so big that it can take several more years to get from one to the other. 

(3b) **One Arm Press to HS in 1on1**: On a similar level of difficulty is the One Arm Press to Handstand on one straight arm of the base, as it requires a whole nother level of stability of both of the partners in order to be performed in a stable manner, apart from a very serious preparation of the top in course of several years. It is performed very rarely at international competitions. Last time it was done by a Chinese Women's Pair at the Worlds in 2024. At the Worlds in 2021 it was shown by a Men's Pair of the Russian Gymnastics Federation.

(4) **1on1 High Arm Roll-Down and Roll-Up**: Even harder than the 360° Sit Down is the Roll-Down, which is a transition not into sitting but into a lying position. The Roll-Down is extremely difficult to perform with a 1on1 HS due to the movement of the body around the arm, where the arm ends up in much weaker positions, while the base changes orientation and rotates himself around his arm, while putting it on the floor, making it much harder to balance due to these fluid changes in orientation. The Roll Down in 1on1 has not been performed on the international level anymore since 2021(?). While being hard, the Roll-Up is much harder. It has not been performed at the international level since ~????. The last one known to have done it successfully outside of competition was Aleksandr Kurennoi with Anastasia Gorbatyuk in 2022(?). 

(5) **1on1 on One Arm Airbaby:** Apart from the extremely difficult motions, there are a few static positions that have been shown to be possible in the past, that are even more difficult and require even more preparation and skill of the base partner. One of these skills is the *One Arm Air Baby*, in which the base performs a sort of Airbaby, but without the knee touching his arm, being pulled up by the top on his free arm, who performs a one arm handstand himself on the hand of the base. This balance has been performed by XX & XX, a Chinese Men's Pair in 19XX and has not been seen anymore since then. 

(6) **1on1 on One Arm Flag:** This element has, as far as I know, not yet been proven to be possible and is not yet part of the Element Catalogue of Acrobatic Gymnastics. It has been performed 2on1 (not with ideal form, due to its extremely difficult balancing demands) outside of the sports by two acrobats, a man and a girl, from the *Shanghai Acrobatic Troupe*, with the girl pressing from a 2on1 Support into a 2on1 HS on the free arm of the base, left-handed, while the base holds a One Arm Flag on his right hand. 


## Most difficult pair balance in H2F

One of the most difficult balances in Hand to Foot, are:

* **2on1 H2F on a Split Mexican**: ...

* **2on1 H2F on a free Scorpion**: ...

* **1on1 H2F on a one-legged Russian lever**: ...

* **2on2 HS on HS / 2on1 HS on HS**: ... The element can be approached via 2on2 Handstands or Supports on Headstands first. Then on Forearm-Stands or on Bent-Arm Handstands between two boxes for preparation. Finally in the Handstand itself. More often than a 2on2 HS is a 2on1 HS or Support, in which the partners start in a Straddle on a Standing Split with the hands of the base on the floor, then slowly shift all the weight onto the hands and away from the standing leg, lifting the leg off the floor and tucking it in.
