# About

AcroLib is a non-commercial project supposed to become a comprehensive online library of acrobatics and a place to promote new initiatives to bring the sports forward. It may also serve as an international "Hub", where you can find all the necessary information you may need in form of a simple website without any scripts and other clutter. It was initiated, developed and is currently curated by [Flosha](https://flosh.in), an acrobatic gymnast and coach from Germany. 

The project consists of several sub-projects (selectable in the menu at the top):


## International Terminology of Acrobatic Gymnastics

In the *International Terminology of Acrobatic Gymnastics* (an ongoing work in progress to which you can [contribute here](https://github.com/floshin/acrolib/edit/main/glossary.md)), you'll find all kinds of terms known from or associated with acrobatic gymnastics, hand-to-hand and floor acro, written by Flosha. 

Over time we will add terms of diverse languages and associate them with related terms from other languages in order to reduce the current confusion when talking about elements with people from another country (or even just another acrobatic school). On the basis on this research we try to suggest a terminology, a common language, based on the most precise and/or most commonly used terms. Later we want to add images or short animations to illustrate many of these terms. 

You can use the search function of your browser to search for terms you heard of but don't know what they mean or to search for terms you already know (you can also type cyrillic) in order to learn how they are called in other languages. 

At the moment we focus on adding English, German and Russian terms. But in the future we would like to also add Portuguese, Hebrew and other languages of the leading federations of the sport. While we try to add terms from diverse languages, the texts will remain English to be accessible for an international audience.

## International Acrobatics Calendar

Self-explanatory, an acrobatics calendar containing all kinds of international, continental, national and regional competitions as well as other acrobatic events. Flosha initiated this project because none of the organisations (at least in Germany) seems to try offering this information. The german federation often only listens a fracture of the events and most regional events have to be found through the websites of the regional federations or via other sources. Athletes and Clubs are also not getting well informed about the available international competitions in different countries; there is no comprehensive overview.

## Acro Community

A simple part of the library containing information about all the Acro organisations, listening local clubs and schools, regional unions, national, continental and international federations as well as circus universities and schools that are teaching Hand to Hand or offer training locations to practice.
